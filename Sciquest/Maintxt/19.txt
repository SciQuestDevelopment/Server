Abstract: Although the lithium‚Äìmetal anode (LMA) can deliver a high theoretical capacity of ‚âà3860 mAh g‚àí1 at a low redox potential of ‚àí3.040 V (vs the standard hydrogen electrode), its application in rechargeable batteries is hindered by the poor Coulombic efficiency and safety issues caused by dendritic metal growth. Consequently, careful electrode design, electrolyte engineering, solid‚Äìelectrolyte interface control, protective layer introduction, and other strategies are suggested as possible solutions. In particular, one should note the great potential of 3D‚Äêstructured electrode materials, which feature high active specific surface areas and stereoscopic structures with multitudinous lithiophilic sites and can therefore facilitate rapid Li‚Äêion flux and metal nucleation as well as mitigate Li dendrite formation through the kinetic control of metal deposition even at high local current densities. This progress report reviews the design of 3D‚Äêstructured electrode materials for LMA according to their categories, namely 1) metal‚Äêbased materials, 2) carbon‚Äêbased materials, and 3) their hybrids, and allows the results obtained under different experimental conditions to be seen at a single glance, thus being helpful for researchers working in related fields.

Introduction: Technological progress has increased the demand for electric vehicles, drones, humanoid robots, smart electronics, and other devices requiring portable power sources with high energy and power densities.[1, 2] Simultaneously, the limitations of energy production due to environmental issues and fossil fuel depletion have prompted the utilization of renewable sources, as exemplified by solar power and biomass energy.[3-5] Given that sustainable energy sources require a large‚Äêscale grid system to achieve a stable energy supply and back‚Äêup their inefficiencies, the development of both mass‚Äêscalable and mobile energy storage devices (ESDs) based on feasible chemistry is a task of high practical importance.[6, 7]

In view of their high energy densities, absence of memory effects, and high round‚Äêtrip energy efficiencies, conventional lithium‚Äêion batteries (LIBs) are widely used on scales ranging from compact electronic devices to grid systems[8, 9] but are currently reaching their maximal capacity, as their specific/volumetric energy densities are limited by the use of heavy metal‚Äêbased active host materials.[10, 11] The use of Li as a high‚Äêenergy active anode material is a possible solution to this problem, as this metal exhibits a high theoretical capacity of ‚âà3860 mAh g‚àí1 and a low redox potential (‚àí3.040 V vs the standard hydrogen electrode).[12, 13] However, the Li‚Äêmetal anode (LMA) has some fatal drawbacks originating from high‚Äêaspect‚Äêratio metal growth, e.g., continuous electrolyte consumption, Coulombic efficiency (CE) reduction, elevated cell polarization due to side reactions producing dead Li, and safety issues caused by electrode short‚Äêcircuiting.[14, 15] Recently, these drawbacks have been addressed by several approaches such as electrode design and electrolyte engineering.[16-21]

Metal growth can be described by a first‚Äêorder linear equation as
dùëÅdùë°+ùê¥ùëÅ=ùê¥ùëÅ0,‚ÄâùëÅ(0)=0
 (1)
where N0, N, and A are the number density of active sites, the density of nucleated particles, and the nucleation rate, respectively. According to the variations in the ratio of the characteristic times of diffusion 1/DN0 and charge transfer 1/kGN01/2 (D and kG denote the diffusion coefficient and the charge transfer rate constant, respectively), three different growth regimes can be distinguished, namely kinetic control (kG/DN01/2 ‚â™ 1), mixed kinetic‚Äêdiffusion control (kG/DN01/2 ‚âà 1), and diffusion control (kG/DN01/2 ‚â´ 1).[22, 23] Diffusion‚Äêcontrolled growth is generally accompanied by the formation of dendritic structures, whereas kinetics‚Äêcontrolled growth leads to identical (homogeneous) metal growth on the overall surface.[24-26] The above equation suggests that both a high density of active sites for metal nucleus formation and a continuous and sufficient supply of Li ions are essential for homogeneous (film‚Äêlike) metal growth.[22] Although the origin of high‚Äêaspect‚Äêratio metal dendrite formation is not entirely understood, several reports suggest that it is closely connected to the above‚Äêmentioned linear equation. According to the diffusion‚Äêcontrolled model, metal dendrite formation is strongly influenced by the concentration of Li ions near the electrode, which, in turn, is dependent on current density. With increasing effective current density, Sand's time (the time required for ion concentration to reach zero) decreases, which leads to metal dendrite growth.[27-30] Mossy dendrites were reported to form under the conditions of insufficient and uneven Li‚Äêion supply, mainly at the hot spots of concentrated Li‚Äêion flux.[31, 32] In addition, metal deposition at a limited number of active sites favors the growth of needle‚Äêlike dendrites, as the continuous supply of Li ions is concentrated on a small number of nuclei even at low current densities. Therefore, the presence of a large number of active sites with low nucleation polarization is expected to promote the formation of metal nuclei and reduce the effective current rate, thus leading to simultaneous metal growth on the whole active surface area.[33-36] Homogeneous metal deposition is expected to result in a high CE and stable cycling as well as alleviate safety issues, thereby allowing Li metal to be used as an active anode material for rechargeable Li‚Äêmetal batteries (LMBs). In particular, high CEs allow one to significantly reduce the consumption of excess Li metal needed to back‚Äêup the loss due to unwanted side reactions and thus sharply increase the energy densities of LMBs.[37, 38]
This review focuses on the recent strategies aiming to augment the active sites for metal nucleation and maintain a sustainable Li‚Äêion supply through the careful design of electrode materials, which can be categorized into metal‚Äêbased, carbon‚Äêbased, and metal/carbon hybrid ones. Despite the large number of different electrode systems prepared in many ways, all of these systems comprise 3D structures that mitigate metal dendrite growth by providing high effective surface areas with lithiophilic sites and thus enhance electrochemical performance. Therefore, the specific design methods and their electrochemical abilities according to the respective categories are especially noteworthy.

Main: 2 Metal‚ÄêBased Electrode Materials
Metal‚Äêbased electrode materials, which include conducting or nonconducting metal compounds and their alloys, can guide homogeneous Li metal deposition in several ways, e.g., through highly Li‚Äêion‚Äêconductive layer formation, lithiophilic compound formation, induction of active nucleation sites and nanoporous structures, and effective surface area extension. In view of the fact that several functions are entangled in a metal‚Äêbased electrode material, it is difficult to specify them as a single directory. Therefore, this chapter deals with bulk 3D current collectors and nanostructured materials.

2.1 3D‚ÄêStructured Metal Current Collectors
The major requirements for the current collectors of conventional LIBs are high electrical conductivity for rapid electron transport and physical robustness to support active materials coated using the slurry process. These properties are also important for LMBs, although more functions are required to impart a high effective surface area to Li metal (active material) and mitigate infinite volume expansion. The use of 3D‚Äêstructured commercial current collectors as LMA materials can be a simple but useful approach, e.g., 3D LMAs were prepared by immersing 3D‚Äêstructured current collectors into molten Li. Moreover, for Li metal‚Äêimpregnated commercial 3D Ni foam and 3D Cu mesh as current collectors (Figure 1a,b), a reduced dimensional change of the LMA after >100 cycles and stable cycling with uniform metal growth were observed.[39-41] Several methods can be used to increase the effective surface area of Cu current collectors and thus improve electrochemical performance, e.g., i) macroporous Cu current collectors were fabricated by a template method using monodisperse poly(methyl methacrylate) nanospheres with a size of ‚âà450 nm,[42] and ii) nano‚Äê/macroporous Cu current collectors were fabricated from a Cu‚ÄìZn alloy by a hydrogen‚Äêbubble dynamic template method followed by dealloying through selective Zn etching (Figure 1c,d).[43-45] In the case of macroporous Cu current collectors, CEs of ‚âà93.3% over 120 cycles were obtained,[42] whereas values of >98.0% over 200 cycles were observed for nanoporous Cu current collectors.[44, 45] The dramatic increase in CE was attributed to the higher effective surface area offered by nanostructures and highlights the importance of the nanostructural design of electrode materials. On the other hand, the limited applicability of simple molten Li infusion to 3D LMAs with a complex nanostructure requires the development of alternative Li composite formation methods in preference to the relatively complex electrochemical Li deposition method.

2.2 Nanostructured Metal‚ÄêBased Electrode Materials
Research on nanostructured metal‚Äêbased electrode materials can be divided into three categories, namely i) the introduction of nanostructured metallic components onto 3D metal current collectors, ii) the design of nanostructured metal‚Äêbased materials on 2D metal current collectors, and iii) the use of free‚Äêstanding nanostructured metal‚Äêbased electrode materials, as is described below.

2.2.1 Introduction of Lithiophilic Inorganic Nanoparticles onto 3D Metal Current Collectors
The decoration of 3D metal current collectors with lithiophilic nanoparticles is a feasible strategy of increasing active surface area and lithiophilicity. The positive effects of Au, Ag, or ZnO nanoparticles introduced onto the surface of 3D metal current collectors were confirmed in terms of both nucleation overpotentials and CEs.[46-48] Accordingly, more advanced nanostructures were developed using lithiated NiCo2O4 nanorods grown on Ni foam to effectively reduce the average current in the electrode (Figure 2a). In addition, the conformal Li2O coating produced in situ on lithiated NiCo2O4 nanorods provided a high effective surface area and surface lithiophilicity, thereby enabling stable Li plating/stripping without Li dendrite growth even at a high current density of 5 mA cm‚àí2.[49] Similar approaches have exploited the synergistic effects between the macroporous metal host and lithiophilic nanomaterials such as Cu nanowires,[50] Cu2O nanowires,[51] CuO nanoflowers,[52] V2O5 nanobelt arrays,[53] and ZnO nanosheets.[54] In particular, Cu2O nanowires on 3D Cu foam exhibited stable cycling behavior for >500 cycles with overpotentials as low as 10 mV (Figure 2b).[51]

2.2.2 Design of Nanostructured Metal‚ÄêBased Materials on 2D Metal Current Collectors
As commercial 3D metal current collectors possess several hundreds of micrometer‚Äêsized macropores and insufficient surface areas, other nanostructures assembled into unique 3D morphologies were investigated. For example, Guo's group introduced high‚Äêaspect‚Äêratio 3D Cu fibers with a sub‚Äêmicrometer skeleton (Figure 2c)[55] prepared by the dehydration of Cu(OH)2 to CuO on Cu foil followed by reduction. The use of these 3D Cu fibers as LMA materials allowed one to suppress the growth of Li dendrites and enabled a 600 h LMA operation without short‚Äêcircuiting. More recently, a vertically grown TiO2 nanotube array with a uniform curvature[56] was shown to generate uniform local electric fields attracting Li ions to the nanotubular surface and thus inducing an even current density distribution. In addition, the well‚Äêdefined nanotube spacing allowed for rapid Li‚Äêion diffusion into the overall active surface area. Therefore, stable cycling (225 cycles, 450 h) at a current density of 4 mA cm‚àí2 and a plating capacity of 4 mAh cm‚àí2 were obtained in a symmetric‚Äêcell test of the nanotube array. As another strategy, ZnO, a conversion reaction‚Äêbased active material for Li storage, was used to construct a vertically grown nanostructure on 2D metal foils (Figure 2d).[57] During lithiation, the ZnO nanorods were transformed into a highly electronically conductive and lithiophilic LiZn/Li2O array that provided nucleation sites for Li deposition and allowed for stable Li plating/stripping (200 cycles) at a current density of 5 mA cm‚àí2. The nanostructured array maintained its initial morphology during repetitive cycles and supplied a buffer alleviating the cycling‚Äêinduced volume change. Similar concepts relying on the conversion reactions of metal oxide nanomaterials such as CuO,[58, 59] NiO,[60] and MnO2,[61] and an alloying reaction producing materials such as Cu3P[62] were reported, and their ability to obstruct dendritic metal growth was demonstrated. In particular, nitrogen plasma‚Äêtreated CuO nanosheets containing doped nitrogen allowed one to obtain high CEs of ‚âà99.6% after 500 cycles at 1 mA cm‚àí2 and 4 mAh cm‚àí2.[59] Moreover, the corresponding symmetric cells were stably operated for 600 h with a small voltage hysteresis of ‚âà23 mV. These results show that the design of nanostructured lithiophilic conversion materials on typical Cu foils can be a promising strategy of guiding uniform metal deposition/stripping cycles. Additionally, Ag and Cu nanoparticle‚Äêcoated porous frameworks were formed as lithiophilic layers on 2D Cu foils (by a chemical plating‚Äêbased solution process and a slurry process, respectively) for homogeneous metal deposition, and the effectiveness of these approaches was demonstrated through half‚Äêcell and full‚Äêcell electrochemical tests.[63, 64]

2.2.3 Free‚ÄêStanding Metal‚ÄêBased Nanoframeworks
The use of heavy/thick metal current collectors places a limit on the specific/volumetric energy densities of the corresponding LMBs. Therefore, high‚Äêaspect‚Äêratio metal nanowires were assembled as a self‚Äêsupported 3D network structure to substitute the typical current collectors (Figure 2e,f).[65-69] The nanostructured host electrode materials can provide a well‚Äêdeveloped conducting network structure and numerous macropores for Li metal storage as well as a high open surface area with active catalytic sites. In addition, such materials can exhibit high flexibility, as shown in Figure 2f) for a free‚Äêstanding 3D Cu nanowire network.[67] In a continuous metal plating/dissolution process conducted for 200 cycles (200 h), several self‚Äêsupported electrode materials such as Ni@Li2O co‚Äêaxial nanowires,[65] free‚Äêstanding Cu nanowire networks,[66] phosphidized 3D Cu nanowire networks,[67] and 3D vanadium nitride (VN) nanowire arrays[68] showed high CEs of 97.3‚Äì99.9% and stable cycling behavior without dendritic metal growth. Zhu et al. reported textile‚Äêstructured hierarchically porous Cu electrodes prepared using a T‚Äêshirt template, showing that the unique 3D structure confined the growth of Li crystals and thus offered the advantages of good cycling stability, low voltage hysteresis, high specific capacity, and low electrode polarization.[69] On the other hand, the electrical conductivities and physical properties of free‚Äêstanding metal nanowire assemblies can be worse than those of typical 2D or 3D current collectors. Therefore, the strong points of self‚Äêsupported metal‚Äêbased nanostructures in LMA performance are expected to become more practicable as the properties of these materials are enhanced.

2.3 Gradient Frameworks
Dendrite growth is mainly induced by heterogeneous metal deposition associated with electrochemical parameters such as current density, cut‚Äêoff capacity, and the concentration of Li ions around the electrode. Among these parameters, Li‚Äêion flux strongly affects the metal deposition process, as metal dendrites can form through diffusion‚Äêcontrolled metal deposition at a high local current density. Therefore, to mitigate Li dendrite formation, many researchers have employed diverse electrode material designs relying on the introduction of high effective specific surface areas and stereoscopic structures to facilitate rapid Li ion flux (Figure 3).[70-73] In many cases, however, the structural control of metal‚Äêbased electrode materials is not sufficient to realize a uniform Li‚Äêion flux to the electrode surface. Numerous empirical observations and simulations revealed the preferential deposition of Li metal at the anode/separator interfaces, which is commonly denoted as a ‚Äútop‚Äêgrowth‚Äù mode. During continuous metal deposition, such growth (especially on the electrode material surface) can slow down the Li‚Äêion flux, which highlights the need for a more specialized approach to guide sequential deposition from the electrode bottom layer. A deposition‚Äêregulating strategy using an electrical conductivity and lithiophilicity gradient structure was employed to address this issue, relying on the construction of a nonconducting Al2O3 layer on the top part of porous Ni foam (Figure 3a), the bottom of which was sputtered with highly conductive Au. As the electrically passivated Al2O3 layer provided a conductivity gradient and acted as a near‚Äêzero nucleation barrier, Au could guide stable Li plating and supply a lithiophilic gradient owing to its high lithiophilicity (Figure 3a).[70] Similar concepts using ionic/electrical conductivity gradient structures were reported, e.g., Al2O3 and Li0.33La0.56TiO3 ceramic nanofiber films,[71] stacks of Cu nanowire layers with different electrical conductivities,[72] Cu nanowires with a phosphidation gradient,[61] and a melamine sponge with variable‚Äêthickness Ni coating[73] (Figure 3b,c). These structures featured CEs of 97.0‚Äì98.4% and stable cycling performances without dendritic metal growth even at high current rates or capacities, which resulted from the favorable deposition of Li metal on the electrode bottom due to the well‚Äêbalanced electrical/ionic conductivities of electrode materials and demonstrated the high practical utility of gradient structures.

2.4 Perspectives of Metal‚ÄêBased Electrode Materials
Table 1 summarizes the electrochemical performances and experimental parameters of metal‚Äêbased electrode materials, revealing that generally, nanostructured materials show better cycling stabilities and CEs than bulk 3D current collectors. On the other hand, nanostructured and gradient‚Äêstructured electrode materials exhibit the drawbacks of large initial irreversible capacity, relatively expensive precursors, and complex fabrication processes. In addition, the difficulty of Li infusion into fine nanostructures complicates the preparation of 3D LMAs based on nanostructured materials, and electrode material uniformity is also an important issue. The listed results were obtained using electrochemical tests performed in coin cells with an area of several square centimeters and a small cut‚Äêoff capacity of <2.0 mAh cm‚àí2 (Table 1). At a small current, the deviation of local current density is insignificant, while in a large practical cell, the inhomogeneity of current density can induce dendritic metal formation. Therefore, future studies should consider the design of uniform nanostructures. Given the above circumstances, macroporous metal nanowire frameworks based on inexpensive Cu or Ni are promising 3D LMA materials, even though their inadequate mechanical robustness and oxidation‚Äêinduced degradation of electrical conductivity are challenges that are yet to be addressed.

3 Carbon‚ÄêBased Electrode Materials
Carbon‚Äêbased materials, which exhibit the advantages of low density, high surface area, high electrical conductivity, tunable properties, cheap and ubiquitous precursors, and well‚Äêknown and straightforward chemistry, can be used to produce LMA‚Äêsuitable state‚Äêof‚Äêthe‚Äêart structures with variable physicochemical properties. Recent works on the widely known nanostructured sp2 carbon allotropes, namely carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene‚Äêbased nanosheets (GNSs), revealed that the 3D structures and surface chemical properties of these materials play key roles in determining their electrochemical performance for reversible Li metal storage. This section reviews the recent design strategies of various carbon‚Äêbased electrode materials, prioritizing two major viewpoints.

3.1 Design of 3D Carbon Structures
Numerous carbon‚Äêbased materials with 3D morphologies and different microstructures can be prepared using different solid‚Äê, liquid‚Äê, and gas‚Äêphase techniques and simple chemistries. As 3D‚Äêstructured carbons exhibit high specific surface areas, numerous pores and tunable porosity, electrically conducting networks, high flexibility, and a large number of active sites for metal nucleation, they are promising alternatives to heavy metal‚Äêbased current collectors used to accommodate Li metal during reversible plating/stripping cycles. CNT sponges, which can be prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), are the first candidates for 3D‚Äêstructured carbon. Yang et al. reported that a CNT sponge designed as a 3D porous current collector exhibited a high affinity to the deposited Li metal and reduced the Li nucleation overpotential (Figure 4a).[74] Although a CE as low as 72.1% was obtained in the first cycle, it sharply increased to 97.5% and 98.8% in the second and tenth cycle, respectively, and stayed at >98.5% during the subsequent 90 cycles. In addition, the CNT sponge cells ran well when subjected to 400 h continuous metal deposition/dissolution cycling. The irreversible capacities due to the active carbon surfaces and the cycling lifetimes of unstable carbon structures can be improved by introducing a protection layer, as exemplified by the coating of CNT sponges with uniform Al2O3 layers.[75] To enhance the physical properties of a CNT sponge, Xie et al. used a hierarchical carbon scaffold fabricated via the annealing‚Äêinduced self‚Äêgrowth of CNTs in Ni‚Äêdecorated melamine sponges.[76] During annealing, the melamine sponges were transformed into nitrogen‚Äêdoped carbon while maintaining their host structures to afford hierarchically coupled carbon structures with CNTs. These hierarchical carbon scaffolds allowed for i) a significantly low overpotential of ‚âà60 mV at a high current density of 5 mA cm‚àí2 and ii) stable cycling for 600 h at 10 mAh cm‚àí2 (Figure 4b).[76] Jin et al. used Ni microwires as a template to synthesize a graphite nanowall on their surface.[77] Template removal by electrolytic dissolution afforded covalently connected graphite microtube networks as a bulk 3D scaffold. The internal pores of these graphite microtubes provided templates for Li accommodation, allowing for an areal capacity of 10 mAh cm‚àí2 (gravimetric capacity = 913 mAh g‚àí1) at a current density of 10 mA cm‚àí2 and a CE of 97% with a lifespan of up to 3000 h (Figure 4c). As a simplified approach, CNT stacks with controllable thickness were prepared by vacuum filtration.[78] The bulk 3D CNT films with a thickness of 50‚Äì200 ¬µm featured an entangled network structure of CNTs on their internal side, where Li metal could be reversibly deposited/dissolved with small volume changes (Figure 4d). In addition, in a symmetric‚Äêcell test, the 3D CNT films featured stable cycling behavior for 600 h at 5 mA cm‚àí2 with a cut‚Äêoff capacity of 3 mAh cm‚àí2. When the CNT networks had more ordered cross‚Äêstacks, the corresponding LMA delivered a specific capacity of ‚âà3656 mAh g‚àí1, which was close to the theoretical capacity (‚âà3860 mAh g‚àí1) of pure Li metal (Figure 4e).[79] In addition, the clear removal of the deposited Li in this well‚Äêorganized structure resulted in a much longer cycling lifetime of >2000 h. Thus, if cross‚Äêstacked CNT sheets can be prepared by a layer‚Äêby‚Äêlayer process on a large scale, they could become a promising candidate for commercial applications.

Commercial carbon fiber cloths have attracted considerable attention as 3D scaffolds for Li metal accommodation. Although woven carbon fiber cloths have lower specific surface areas and porosities than 3D CNT stacks, the former feature excellent mechanical properties, high electrical conductivity, good chemical stability, and abundant macropores. Several studies reported that commercial carbon cloth (paper) can be a useful LMA material.[80-82] For example, dendritic Li formation was effectively mitigated by a carbon cloth with a high areal capacity of >8 mAh cm‚àí2. Moreover, despite their similar woven fabric structures, a T‚Äêshirt‚Äêderived carbon cloth showed an electrochemical performance different to that of a commercial carbon cloth.[83] As a more advanced design strategy, CNT networks were fabricated on the surface of carbon cloths as hierarchically porous structures (Figure 4f).[84] In these hybrid structures, the CNT network allowed one to significantly increase the otherwise insufficient specific surface area of the rigid carbon cloths while preserving their good mechanical properties. These synergistic effects resulted in a low voltage hysteresis of 71 mV at a high current density of 5 mA cm‚àí2 over a cycling time of 500 h. Furthermore, full cells with a hybrid carbon structure‚Äêbased LMA and a LiFePO4 cathode showed a high capacity retention of 98.1% and a high CE of ‚âà99% after 100 cycles.[84]

3D‚Äêstructured self‚Äêsupported electrode materials can be also constructed from GNSs by a broad range of methods, and hence, several unique structures were suggested.[85-88] Li et al. reported that heavy metal‚Äêbased current collectors can be substituted with relatively lightweight GNS‚Äêbased frameworks that have more lithiophilic sites and hierarchically porous structures and can be obtained by a Cu foam‚Äêassisted template method.[85] Pan et al. used uniform polystyrene spheres to prepare 3D graphene frameworks comprising 3D periodic hollow spheres with interconnected 3D ion‚Äêdiffusion channels by a template method (Figure 4g).[86] As a hybrid carbon structure, a carbon nanofiber‚Äêstabilized graphene aerogel film host was prepared from electrospun carbon nanofibers and graphene oxide using chemical reduction and a solution casting method.[87] In addition, vertically grown edge‚Äêrich GNSs were fabricated on SiO2 nanowire@carbon nanofiber networks with a density of 0.012 g cm‚àí3 by low‚Äêpressure CVD at 5 kPa.[88] The resulting 3D‚Äêstructured electrodes showed a high CE of ‚âà99% for a cycling time of >700 h in symmetric‚Äêcell tests, while a long lifespan of 1000 cycles with a CE of 99.7% was achieved in full‚Äêcell tests.[87, 88] As a simplified strategy, a Li‚ÄêGNS composite film was fabricated via the infusion of molten Li into a porous GNS stack (Figure 4h).[89] This film was highly flexible and could be prepared with a GNS loading of only 7 wt%, exhibiting specific capacities of up to ‚âà3390 mAh g‚àí1, a low nucleation overpotential of ‚âà80 mV at 3 mA cm‚àí2, and stable cycling behavior with a small electrode dimension change of ‚âà20%. The Li composite strategy was also applied to several porous carbon hosts to probe their effects on LMA performance.[90-94] A Li alloy‚ÄêGNS composite film was reported as an alternative to Li‚ÄêGNS composites, allowing one to avoid the intrinsic problems due to dendritic metal growth (Figure 4i) and featuring a volumetric capacity of 1800‚Äì2000 mAh cm‚àí3, which corresponded to the theoretical value of Li metal (‚âà2060 mAh cm‚àí3). Finally, fully expanded LixSi alloys confined in a graphene matrix demonstrated stable cycling (400 cycles with 98% capacity retention) at areal capacity of ‚âà2.4 mAh cm‚àí2 and were therefore concluded to be promising LMA materials.[91]

3.2 Introduction of Carbon‚ÄêBased Materials with Functional Groups
Li nucleation behavior is considerably affected by the surface properties of the matrix, e.g., lithiophilic matrices with good affinities to metallic Li offer numerous nucleation sites, guiding homogeneous metal deposition by reducing nucleation polarization in the overall active surface area. In the case of 3D host structures with high effective surface area, the introduction of lithiophilic functional groups is essential to achieve highly stable Li deposition/dissolution cycling with no dendrite formation.

3.2.1 Nitrogen‚ÄêDoped Carbon‚ÄêBased Materials
Niu et al. reported that Li metal roughly deposited on an amine‚Äêfunctionalized carbon surface became smooth upon cycling, which was denoted as self‚Äêsmoothing behavior (Figure 5a).[95] The amine groups on the carbon host changed its Li wettability from nonwetting to superwetting, and the more favorable interaction between the deposited Li and the carbon host led to the deposition of Li along the host surface. In addition, the pore channels or cavities on the host surface were the preferred sites of initial Li nucleation during plating, and pore/cavity self‚Äêfilling was observed. As a result, an LMA based on mesoporous carbon nanofibers coupled with a Li Ni‚ÄìMn‚ÄìCo oxide cathode exhibited a cell‚Äêlevel energy density of 350‚Äì380 Wh kg‚àí1 and stable cycling for up to 200 cycles. This report highlighted the wettability of Li and the mesopores of the carbon materials as hosts for Li metal storage. Zhang et al. reported the effects of pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen functional groups, using GNSs with several nitrogen configurations as an electrode material to guide Li metal deposition/dissolution.[96] Pyrrolic and pyridinic nitrogens were reported to exhibit Li‚Äêatom binding energies (‚àí4.46 and ‚àí4.26 eV, respectively) larger than those of graphene (‚àí3.64 eV) and Cu (‚àí2.57 eV) (Figure 5b). GNSs with pyrrolic and pyridinic nitrogens, which have one extra electron and a lone pair of electrons, respectively, are expected to be electron‚Äêrich donors with filled p‚Äêorbitals, acting as Lewis‚Äêbasic sites to strongly adsorb Lewis‚Äêacidic Li ions from electrolytes through acid‚Äìbase interactions and guiding the uniform distribution of Li metal nuclei over the GNS surface. Although the nitrogen content of GNSs was determined as ‚âà3.14 at%, these materials effectively provided lithiophilic sites and guided dendritic metal‚Äêfree cycling to afford high electrochemical performance with CE ‚âà 98% for 200 cycles at a current density of 1.0 mA cm‚àí2 and an areal capacity of 1.0 mAh cm‚àí2.

The lithiophilic effects of nitrogen functional groups can be maximized by the combination of these groups with 3D electrode materials featuring higher effective surface areas. Liu et al. prepared nitrogen‚Äêdoped graphitic carbon foam by pyrolysis of waste melamine foam,[97] showing that the former foam featured a specific surface area of 328 m2 g‚àí1 and a (mainly pyridinic and pyrrolic) nitrogen content of 2.84 at%. The above graphitic foam allowed one to realize a high CE of ‚âà99.6% and a cycling lifetime of 1200 h. In addition, a self‚Äêsupported nitrogen‚Äêdoped carbon rod array constructed on Cu foil using a wet chemistry process followed by carbonization was used as an electrode for Li metal storage.[98] This 3D porous carbon rod array had a high (mainly pyridinic and pyrrolic) nitrogen content of ‚âà9.43 at% but achieved a CE of only 97% after 80 cycles at an areal capacity of 2.0 mAh cm‚àí2. This electrochemical performance was inferior to those of other electrode materials with smaller nitrogen contents, which indicated that the electrochemical performance of carbon‚Äêbased electrode materials is not linearly dependent on their nitrogen content. The above behavior could be related to the chemical stability of functionalized carbon materials. A previous study disclosed a close relationship between carbon crystallinity and cyclability,[99] e.g., when an amorphous carbon‚Äêbased self‚Äêsupported electrode was degraded by repetitive cycling, CE started to fluctuate after the 150th cycle, whereas a highly crystalline carbon‚Äêbased electrode endured more than 1000 cycles with a CE of >99% (Figure 5c). Therefore, to design high‚Äêperformance carbon‚Äêbased LMA materials, one should consider the chemical stability of functionalized carbon structures. In this context, the surface coating of conductive carbon networks with lithiophilic molecules can be a suitable means of maintaining the chemical stability of carbon hosts. Chen et al. reported that porphyrin‚Äêcoated CNT scaffolds delivered high CEs of ‚âà98.5% for 750 cycles in half‚Äêcell tests, while an improved capacity retention of 80.1% after 100 cycles was obtained in full‚Äêcell tests with a LiFePO4 cathode.[100] Lu et al. introduced a rigid and nitrogen‚Äêrich graphitic carbon nitride coating layer on 3D Ni foam to obtain a long lifespan of 900 h, a low overpotential of <15 mV at 1.0 mA cm‚àí2, and a high areal capacity of 9.0 mAh cm‚àí2.[101]

3.2.2 Oxygen‚ÄêDoped Carbon‚ÄêBased Materials
Oxygenated functional groups on carbon‚Äêbased materials are well‚Äêknown redox hosts for Li‚Äêion storage,[102] allowing for LiÔ£øO bond formation within a feasible potential window. Owing to the higher electronegativity of oxygen (3.44) compared to that of Li (0.98), the interaction between oxygen and Li atoms is analogous to Li bonding that can be explained by the Lewis acidity theory.[103] An extra pair of electrons in the carboxylic group is expected to make it an electron‚Äêrich donor naturally acting as a Lewis‚Äêbasic site to strongly bind Lewis‚Äêacidic Li ions. The length of the formed LiÔ£øO bond (1.79 √Ö) was shown to be shorter than that in crystalline Li2O (2.02 √Ö), indicating a strong interaction between the Li atom and carboxylic oxygen. In general, a higher energy of precursor nucleus binding facilitates the heterogeneous nucleation process by decreasing surface tension against the substrate. Therefore, carbon hosts with oxygenated functional groups are expected to reduce the Li nucleation overpotential.[103] In addition, oxygen atoms also interact with the delocalized œÄ‚Äêsystem of the carbon host and thus acquire a negative charge similar to that of nitrogen atoms. Chen et al. reported that the filled p‚Äêorbitals of fluorine (electronegativity = 3.98) form a p‚ÄìœÄ conjugation network with the carbon plane to back‚Äêfeed electrons from fluorine to carbon, which makes the effective electronegativity of fluorine less than that of oxygen (Figure 6a).[103] Hence, oxygenated functional groups can be some of the most lithiophilic sites in single‚Äêelement‚Äêdoped carbon hosts.

Cui et al. reported that nitric acid‚Äêtreated electrospun carbon nanofibers featured a significantly reduced nucleation overpotential and retained their charge transfer resistance during the first 150 h of running time, which indicated the controlled plating of a uniform Li film (Figure 6b).[104] In addition, oxygen‚Äêenriched lignin‚Äêderived carbon membranes prepared by the electrospinning of lignin with phenol and formaldehyde followed by carbonization and ultraviolet/ozone treatments were tested as LMA materials.[106] Interestingly, in the absence of metal substrates or conductive agents, oxygen‚Äêrich samples showed better cycling performance than those with a moderate oxygen content, which was in stark contrast with the results obtained for nitrogen‚Äêenriched samples.[98] The limited amount of available information makes it difficult to confirm the relationship between oxygenated functional group content and chemical stability during cycling for reversible Li metal storage. Therefore, oxygen‚Äêrich self‚Äêsupported carbon materials should be further researched.

Liu et al. reported a facile and scalable ultrafast method (denoted as the ‚Äúbarbecue‚Äù approach) of fabricating oxygen‚Äêrich CNT networks, demonstrating the formation of these networks on Ni foam within tens of seconds of exposure to an alcohol lamp flame.[106] The thus produced networks exhibited a much smoother voltage dip at the nucleation stage, showing an overpotential of only ‚àí31.3 mV, which was smaller than that (‚àí99.5 mV) of Ni foam (Figure 6c). In addition, a symmetric‚Äêcell test showed that over 200 cycles, the networks retained their stability and maintained a steady overpotential of ‚âà35 mV. In contrast, the symmetric‚Äêcell test of bare Li afforded highly fluctuating profiles with an overpotential of >100 mV. The effectiveness of oxygenated functional groups was also demonstrated in several further works.[102-107]

3.2.3 Dual Heteroatom‚ÄêDoped Carbon‚ÄêBased Materials
The introduction of single‚Äêatom dopants with high electronegativity and a strong local dipole, e.g., oxygen and nitrogen, results in a high Li binding energy and thus significantly decreases the Li nucleation overpotential. Chen et al. suggested that elements less electronegative than carbon can form much stronger local dipoles with adjacent oxygen atoms,[103] claiming that oxygen/boron, oxygen/sulfhur, and oxygen/phosphorous doping of carbon‚Äêbased materials can result in binding energies larger than those achieved by oxygen‚Äêonly doping. Chen et al. also performed a pioneering experimental study of sulfur/nitrogen co‚Äêdoping, revealing that a higher Li‚Äês and S‚Äêp/N‚Äêp orbital hybridization degree can result in a stronger adsorption of Li atoms.[108] The sulfur/nitrogen co‚Äêdoped carbon electrode featured a high CE of ‚âà98% during ‚âà250 cycles at 1 mA cm‚àí2 and a cycling capacity of 1 mAh cm‚àí2, which exceeded the value obtained for nondoped, sulfur‚Äêonly‚Äêdoped, and nitrogen‚Äêonly‚Äêdoped carbon electrodes (Figure 6d). In addition, in oxygen/nitrogen co‚Äêdoped porous carbon electrodes,[109] the highly electronegative heteroatoms effectively guided uniform Li nucleation by reducing the regional electrical field and boosting stable and homogeneous Li plating over 350 cycles with a CE of >99%.[109] Moreover, despite the multitude of possible heteroatom combinations, reports on the corresponding co‚Äêdoped systems are few, and further investigations in this field are therefore needed.

3.3 Perspectives of Carbon‚ÄêBased Electrode Materials
Carbon‚Äêbased electrode materials have a much higher active surface area and more catalytic Li metal nucleation sites than metal‚Äêbased electrode materials, thus featuring a better electrochemical performance for reversible Li metal storage (Table 2). In particular, the introduction of nitrogen‚Äêcontaining functional groups resulted in a high CE of >99.8% and a low nucleation overpotential of ‚âà12 mV in coin cell tests. These results highlight the importance of active surface area and nucleation sites for homogeneous Li metal deposition/dissolution cycles. On the other hand, detailed experimental comparison required to shed further light on the roles of carbon microstructures and extrinsic defects is currently insufficient, and the effects of nanopores and microscopic geometries on Li metal growth remain unclear. The degradation mechanism of reactive functional groups on carbon‚Äêbased materials should be investigated to improve their chemical stability, as active carbon surfaces can be degraded upon cycling. In addition, the large irreversible capacities and continuous Li‚Äêion consumption during initial cycles, relatively poor mechanical properties, and inadequate electrical conductivities should be addressed in future research.

4 Metal‚ÄêCarbon Hybrid Electrode Materials
4.1 3D Carbon Frameworks with Lithiophilic Metal‚ÄêBased Nanoparticles
Hybrid electrodes based on both metal and carbon components have been mainly constructed to maximize their respective advantages, through building 3D macroporous carbon‚Äêbased frames with interconnected structures and the introduction of lithiophilic metal‚Äêbased materials. Self‚Äêsupported carbon nanofibers are the preferred carbon frame, as they exhibit the advantages of high specific open surface area, macroporous structure, and well‚Äêdefined conducting network, and can be easily fabricated by electrospinning.[110-114] Ag,[110] TiN,[111] Li6.4La3Zr2Al0.2O12,[112] Sn,[113] and Cu nanoparticles[114] were used as lithiophilic materials on the surface of carbon networks, and the resulting composites delivered high areal and volumetric capacities of 16 mAh cm‚àí2 and 1600 mAh cm‚àí3, respectively, which led to a low overpotential of <25 mV and a long lifetime of 1000 h (Figure 7a).[110-114] As a carbon framework, GNSs with a large surface area and oxygenated functional groups were also used in combination with lithiophilic metal‚Äêbased nanoparticles.[115-118] The effective surface area of GNSs was further increased through template‚Äêguided self‚Äêassembly,[115] while the introduction of nitrogen‚Äêcontaining functional groups increased GNS lithiophilicity.[115, 116] GNSs hybridized with metal‚Äêbased lithiophilic nanoparticles such as Co, Ni3N, Cu2O, and Au ones showed excellent electrochemical performance and effectively guided highly homogeneous metal deposition.[115-119] In particular, heteroatom‚Äêrich GNSs with Co nanoparticles showed a very low nucleation overpotential of ‚âà17 mV (Figure 7b), while NiN‚Äêhybridized nitrogen‚Äêrich GNSs showed stable Li plating/stripping cycling behavior for 1400 h at 1 mA cm‚àí2 (Figure 7c). As carbon frameworks, commercial carbon papers/cloths were also hybridized with lithiophilic metal‚Äêbased nanoparticles,[120-123] and carbon fibers coated with SnO2,[120] Ag,[121] and ZnO nanoparticles[122] as well as Co3O4 nanofibers[123] were shown to be promising LMA materials (Figure 7d). In addition, a wood‚Äêderived carbon frame with Ag nanoparticles and a 3D core‚Äìshell nanowire skeleton comprising a TiC core and a carbon shell was reported as a feasible electrode for guiding stable Li metal deposition/dissolution (Figure 7e).[124, 125]

4.2 3D Carbon Frameworks on Metal Substrates
3D structures based on CNTs and GNSs can be constructed on metal substrates, which, despite being unfavorable in terms of specific energy density, can provide high mechanical stability and highly conductive electron pathways for carbon structures. Therefore, the combination of a 3D carbon structure and a metal substrate can be a feasible strategy for LMA fabrication, particularly in the case of large‚Äêscale electrodes. Shen et al. prepared 3D CNT hosts with an interconnected network structure on Cu foil by a typical CVD method using ferrocene dissolved in 1,2‚Äêdichlorobenzene as a precursor (Figure 8a).[126] These hosts allowed for stable cycling with a high CE of ‚âà99% at 1 mA cm‚àí2 over 250 cycles. Yang et al. reported a GNS‚Äêanchored Cu foam as a 3D electrode for Li metal storage.[127] GNSs were prepared from graphene oxide, which, in turn, was produced from graphite using the method of Hummers. The graphene oxide was coated on Cu foam by simple dip‚Äêcoating, and the graphene oxide‚Äêcoated Cu foam was thermally treated in an atmosphere of N2 to reduce graphene oxide to GNSs. Compared to bare Cu foam, the resulting GNS‚Äêanchored Cu foam showed enhanced cyclability (CE ‚âà 98.6% over 250 cycles). Similar but more developed porous 3D GNS structures were incorporated on 3D Ni foam and a 3D Cu mesh using CVD.[128, 129] Vertically grown GNS nanowalls on 3D metal substrates provided a more confined nanospace for Li metal and thus significantly improved Li‚Äêion transfer kinetics (Figure 8b), reduced the voltage hysteresis by 30 mV, and allowed for stable cycling during 2000 h in symmetric‚Äêcell tests.[128] More importantly, all‚Äêsolid‚Äêstate full cells with a 3D GNS‚Äêbased LMA and a LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode demonstrated significantly reduced polarization and a capacity retention of ‚âà84% after 50 cycles (Figure 8c).[129]

As a further specific electrode design, Cao et al. introduced highly ordered and interconnected mesoporous carbon prepared by a template method, using the Fe3O4 superlattice as a host structure for Li metal storage on a 2D metal substrate.[130] The ordered mesoporous carbon host on metal foil had a high specific surface area of 1198 m2 g‚àí1 and uniform nanopores (‚âà9.2 nm in size), which led to homogeneous metal deposition with no dendritic metal growth at a high current density of 3 mA cm‚àí2 and an areal capacity of 3 mAh cm‚àí2. In addition, hollow carbon nanocages,[131] vertically aligned carbon nanofibers,[132] and ball‚Äêmilled graphite particles[133] were introduced onto metal foils, and the resulting hybrids were used as 3D host materials for Li metal storage.

As a more feasible approach, Ag nanoparticles (‚âà60 nm) and carbon black powder (35 nm) were coated on metal foil using a typical slurry method.[134] The Ag‚ÄìC composite electrode first reacted with Li ions in the initial stages of lithiation to form amorphous Li‚ÄìAg alloys. A large portion of Ag was dissolved in the plated Li metal to assist the uniform and dendrite‚Äêfree deposition of Li by forming a solid solution. When a 0.6 Ah full‚Äêcell device was fabricated using a conventional intercalation‚Äêbased cathode and a solid electrolyte, the Ag‚ÄìC composite electrode afforded a high energy density of ‚âà900 Wh L‚àí1 and long cycling lifetime (1000 cycles) with a CE of ‚âà99.8%. The authors claimed that a prototype LMB of a >5 Ah class was realized using a metal‚Äìcarbon hybrid anode, demonstrating that the combination of metal‚Äê and carbon‚Äêbased electrode material advantages is a promising strategy for future LMB development. If the metal current collector can be substituted by a 3D carbon frame and a cheaper metal such as Fe can be used as a catalytic material, metal‚Äìcarbon hybrid electrodes are expected to show even greater promise.

4.3 Perspectives of Metal‚ÄìCarbon Hybrid Electrode Materials
Current studies mainly focus on simple hybrid or mixed structures to emphasize the specific advantages of both metal and carbon components. As mentioned above, the good electrochemical performance of hybrid electrodes (e.g., high CE and good cyclability) was partly ascribed to the synergistic effects of their components (Table 3). The metal‚Äìcarbon synergy can be maximized when the corresponding structure is more conjunctly bound, as in the case of metal‚Äìcarbon core‚Äìshell structures. In these structures, the oxidation stability of metal nanowires can be improved through surface coating by nitrogen‚Äêdoped carbon materials, and the nanowire active surface can be significantly extended using a functionalized carbon layer. Moreover, core‚Äìshell structures can show higher electrical conductivities than carbon‚Äêbased frameworks. Hence, the design of systematic hybrid structures requires further intensive studies.

Conclusion: This review outlines the recent progress in the design of LMA materials and describes the diversification of approaches from the use of commercial current collectors to state‚Äêof‚Äêthe‚Äêart nanostructuring. The use of 3D‚Äêstructured electrode materials (metal‚Äêbased materials, carbon‚Äêbased materials, and their hybrids) is shown to mitigate metal dendrite formation and lead to highly stable and reversible Li metal plating/stripping cycles with high CEs, while nanostructured architectures and self‚Äêsupported host structures increase the active surface area and provide efficient accommodation space for the deposited Li metal. The highly effective surfaces with lithiophilic active sites are revealed to secure a continuous and sufficient supply of Li ions to the overall electrode surfaces and thus induce homogeneous metal growth. In addition, porous host structures are demonstrated to minimize the volume expansion due to Li metal deposition and guide stable cycling performance. Figure 9 presents a schematic diagram of the effects of 3D‚Äêstructured electrode materials for reversible Li metal storage. The presented results confirmed the key factors (e.g., high active surface area, lithiophilicity, and 3D porous structure) of successful LMA design; however, high effective surface areas can cause a severe consumption of Li and the electrolyte during repeated Li stripping/plating cycles. Hence, a strategy of protecting the interfacial area needs to be developed.

Effects of 3D‚Äêstructured and non‚Äê3D‚Äêstructured electrode materials on reversible Li metal storage.
The directions of future work can be summarized as follows:
1)Systematic studies need to be performed under integrated experimental conditions, e.g., at the same current densities, cut‚Äêoff capacities, areal loadings of electrode materials, electrolyte systems, and cell types.
2)The electrochemical performances of 3D electrode materials with different architectures, surface properties, and active surface areas need to be compared for the same experimental system.
3)A mechanistic study of metal nucleation and growth in different electrode systems needs to be performed.
4)Protection layers on the surface of 3D electrode materials need to be developed to reduce Li and electrolyte consumption.
5)Anode‚Äêfree or anode‚Äêminimized full‚Äêcell tests with 3D electrode‚Äêbased LMAs have to be conducted.
6)The effects of dual‚Äêheteroatom (O/S, O/B, or N/S) doping and other parameters on the performance of 3D carbon‚Äêbased electrodes need to be studied.
Although the use of high‚Äêperformance 3D‚Äêstructured electrode materials allows one to considerably improve LMB safety and cycling lifetime, more in‚Äêdepth studies on LMAs are needed. Overall, LMBs have considerable commercial potential in applications ranging from mobile electronic devices to large‚Äêscale ESDs.
