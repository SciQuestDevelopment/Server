Abstract: Precise patterning of quantum dot (QD) layers is an important prerequisite for fabricating QD light‐emitting diode (QLED) displays and other optoelectronic devices. However, conventional patterning methods cannot simultaneously meet the stringent requirements of resolution, throughput, and uniformity of the pattern profile while maintaining a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the patterned QD layers. Here, a specially designed nanocrystal ink is introduced, “photopatternable emissive nanocrystals” (PENs), which satisfies these requirements. Photoacid generators in the PEN inks allow photoresist‐free, high‐resolution optical patterning of QDs through photochemical reactions and in situ ligand exchange in QD films. Various fluorescence and electroluminescence patterns with a feature size down to ≈1.5 µm are demonstrated using red, green, and blue PEN inks. The patterned QD films maintain ≈75% of original PLQY and the electroluminescence characteristics of the patterned QLEDs are comparable to thopse of non‐patterned control devices. The patterning mechanism is elucidated by in‐depth investigation of the photochemical transformations of the photoacid generators and changes in the optical properties of the QDs at each patterning step. This advanced patterning method provides a new way for additive manufacturing of integrated optoelectronic devices using colloidal QDs.

Main: Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as promising low‐dimensional building blocks for light‐emitting diodes (LEDs) and displays because of their excellent optical characteristics combining high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) approaching unity, narrow emission spectra, and continuously‐tunable emission colors controlled by the QD size and composition.[1-4] Particularly, high color purity and durability of QDs combined with their solution processability enabled a rapid growth of commercial QD displays. The next‐generation QD‐based displays will likely use QD layers directly as color filters or electroluminescent emission layers (EMLs) in QD LEDs (QLEDs) for higher color purity and efficiency.[5] These technologies require precise patterning of QDs because the QDs emitting in different spectral range need to be deposited as sub‐pixels forming red, green, and blue (RGB) matrix.

Ideally, the patterning of QDs for QLEDs should simultaneously satisfy the following set of requirements: 1) high resolution, ideally sub‐micrometer, 2) high throughput, 3) high fidelity, 4) uniform pattern profile, 5) no contamination nor damage of the other device layers during the patterning process, and 6) retention of QDs’ radiative recombination efficiency which affects the efficiency and brightness of QLEDs. However, patterning of solution‐processed QD layers is challenging as of now because conventional methods (e.g., traditional photolithography, transfer printing, inkjet printing,) cannot simultaneously satisfy all the above requirements. Conventional photolithography can easily achieve sub‐micrometer resolutions and high throughput due to the parallel nature of optical patterning, but polymer photoresists swell in organic solvents. Moreover, the capillary forces developed in QD inks cause nonuniform pattern profiles[6] (see Text SA, Supporting Information for more details). Transfer printing allows high‐resolution (an order of sub‐micrometers) QD patterning using an elastomeric stamp.[7] However, nonuniformities in the pressure during the transfer step decrease fidelity, especially for large‐area devices. Inkjet printing of QD inks has an advantage of low material consumption.[8] However, inkjet printing has relatively low resolution (≈20 µm) and often results in nonuniform pattern profile due to the coffee‐ring effect.[9]

Our group reported an alternative photoresist‐free patterning method, named as “direct optical lithography of functional inorganic nanomaterials” (DOLFIN), which employs specially engineered photosensitive surface ligands that combine colloidal stabilization and passivation of surface dangling bonds with optically triggered chemical activity.[10, 11] In DOLFIN, optical excitation of the photosensitive ligands gives rise to chemical transformations that alter the solubility of QDs. DOLFIN enables simple high‐resolution patterning of various inorganic colloidal nanocrystals (e.g., metals, metal oxides, and semiconductors) with various ultraviolet (UV)–vis excitation sources. However, in the case of patterning luminescent QDs, the ligand exchange process induced significant drops in the PLQY by more than 55% (for Sn2S64− ligands)[12] or 40% (for ammonium dithiocarbamate ligands)[11] of the original PLQY. These drops may be attributed to both the formation of surface defects during the ligand exchange and the enhanced Förster resonance energy transfer into adjacent QDs due to reduced interparticle distance.[13] In addition, the insulating nature of the photochemically active additives can inhibit charge transport in QLEDs and consequently deteriorate electroluminescence (EL) efficiency; therefore, the amounts of additives should be carefully optimized. These challenges motivated us to develop a different DOLFIN method, which does not compromise the luminescent properties of QDs and charge transport ability of QD EML in QLEDs.

Here, we present an advanced DOLFIN method for patterning luminescent core/shell QDs and QLEDs. A specially‐designed QD ink, named as “photopatternable emissive nanocrystals (PENs)” is introduced to minimize the loss in the PLQY of QDs and the EL efficiency of QLEDs caused by patterning process. The PEN inks consist of a non‐polar solvent containing luminescent core/shell QDs capped with long‐chain organic surface ligands and photoacid generator (PAG) which enables a set of photochemically activated reactions between the surface ligands of QDs and the PAGs, leading to in situ ligand exchange in the QD films. This results in a significant change of the dissolution rate of the QD films, allowing the formation of QD patterns. Because of the high photosensitivity of PAGs with respect to UV (365 nm) or blue light (405 nm), high‐resolution QD patterns with a feature size of 1.5 µm were easily achieved with a small amount of PAG (1–3 wt%) in the PEN ink. Because of the small PAG concentration, the core/shell QDs were able to retain ≈85% and ≈75% of the initial PLQY after DOLFIN process in solution and film states, respectively. By using this strategy to pattern QD EMLs in QLEDs, high‐resolution patterned QLEDs with high‐definition EL patterns were fabricated. The patterned QLED showed EL characteristics comparable to those of QLED made with traditional QD inks. In addition, the patterning mechanism was investigated in depth by analyzing photolytic pathways of PAGs and changes in optical properties of QDs at each patterning step.

The schematic concept of DOLFIN with PEN inks is shown in Figure 1A. In all experiments, CdSe‐based RGB core/shell QDs (CdSe/Cd1−xZnxS (red), CdSe/Cd1−xZnxSe1−ySy/ZnS (green), and CdSe/Cd1−xZnxSe1−ySy (blue) with PL emission peaks at 635, 520, and 486 nm, respectively) were used because of their high PLQY, high colloidal stability, and facile synthesis. (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The QD pattern was formed with a four‐step procedure: 1) adding PAG molecules to a toluene solution of QDs to prepare PEN inks, 2) spin‐coating of the PEN inks onto a substrate, 3) light exposure (365 or 405 nm), and 4) development of the QD patterns using a non‐polar solvent for non‐exposed QDs (toluene) (Figure 1B). This process has fewer steps compared to the conventional photolithography which involves additional steps of photoresist spin‐coating and lift‐off.

C) Steady‐state photolysis of MBT with 0.1 vol% octylamine in toluene. UV–vis absorption spectra were measured at different irradiation times (power density = 30 mW cm−2).
The choice of PAG is extremely important in DOLFIN because it determines the pattern quality (e.g., resolution), the exposure dose as well as the optical and electrical properties of resulting QD patterns. With careful consideration of the requirements (see Text SB, Supporting Information), we chose two different PAG molecules for PEN inks: 1) 2‐(4‐methoxystyryl)‐4,6‐bis(trichloromethyl)‐1,3,5‐triazine (MBT) and 2) 2‐diazo‐1‐naphthol‐4‐sulfonic acid (DNS) (Figure 1B). MBT is a triazine‐based PAG that decomposes into a chlorine radical and an MBT radical (MBT(−Cl•)) upon irradiation.[14] DNS is a derivative of diazonaphthoquinone with a sulfo group. Upon irradiation, DNS converts into an indene ring with carboxyl and sulfo groups.[11] Both MBT and DNS have a broad absorption spectrum ranging from 300 nm to 450 nm (Figure 1C; Figure S2A, Supporting Information), therefore, these PAGs can be used for both i‐line (365 nm) and h‐line (405 nm) photons. Also, they are both highly soluble in toluene (>10 mg mL−1), which is a good solvent for processing core/shell QDs.

To evaluate the photosensitivity of MBT and DNS, the evolutions of UV–vis absorption spectra of the PAGs were investigated upon irradiation (i‐line was used for MBT and h‐line for DNS; power density = 30 mW cm−2 for both). For MBT in toluene (10 mg mL−1), the absorbance decreased by 48% after 5 s of UV exposure and then slowly decreased afterward (Figure 1C). DNS showed higher photosensitivity than MBT; the absorbance of DNS decreased to 2% of the original value after 5 s of light exposure and further decreased to zero in 10 s (Figure S2A, Supporting Information).

The patterning mechanisms of the PEN inks were investigated by performing a series of experiments regarding photolysis of PAG molecules (Figure 2A). The photolytic reactions often involve formation of reactive radicals that undergo further transformations.[14] We therefore carried out electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements for MBT solutions using N‐tert‐butyl‐α‐phenylnitrone (PBN) as a spin trap. Before irradiation with UV light, the MBT–PBN solution was EPR silent. However, after exposure to a UV light (365 nm), a strong EPR signal was observed (Figure 2B). The EPR spectrum displays distinct hyperfine splitting consistent with the formation of PBN/Cl∙ adduct based on the simulation and literature.[14, 15] The formation of this radical adduct confirms that the photolysis reaction of MBT involves the generation of radicals (Scheme I in Figure 2A). The detailed EPR parameters and simulation are discussed in Text SC, Supporting Information. In the absence of PBN spin trap, highly reactive Cl· radicals are expected to react with solvent or other chemical species generating acid. To verify this, we used rhodamine B base which is colorless and non‐fluorescent but transforms into a fluorescent open‐ring structure with pink color in an acidic environment.[16] After short irradiation with 365 nm light, the mixtures of MBT and rhodamine B base in toluene showed dramatic changes in color (from colorless to pink) as well as in the absorption spectra (Figure S3, Supporting Information), verifying efficient generation of acidic species from MBT in toluene. The reaction of Cl· with toluene or alkyl amines produces HCl and benzylic radicals[17] (or α‐aminoalkyl radicals)[18] (Scheme II,III in Figure 2A). Subsequently, the produced HCl protonates the bound oleate ligands at the surface of the core/shell QDs, leaving free oleic acids and chloride‐bound QD surface (Scheme V). These sequential reactions alter the solubility of deposited QD films in the light‐exposed regions. The patterning mechanism with DNS (Scheme IV,VI in Figure 2A) and the roles of solvent and additives on the photolysis mechanism of MBT are investigated in depth and discussed in the Supporting Information (Figure S4 and Text SD,E). The presence of chloride on the QD surface was further supported by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Figure S5; Text SF, Supporting Information).

A) Patterning mechanism of DOLFIN based on the photolysis of MBT and DNS in the PEN inks. B) X‐band EPR spectrum of 0.53 mM MBT in toluene collected before and after UV irradiation (365 nm for 60 s). PBN was used as a spin trap. For experimental and simulation parameters, see Supporting Information. C) FTIR spectra of QD, MBT, and QD:MBT films with 20 wt% MBT. An order of magnitude larger amount of MBT (20 wt% vs. 1–3 wt% was used for patterning.) was used to intentionally amplify the contribution of MBT to the FTIR spectra. The major peaks were marked with dotted and dashed lines (QD and MBT peaks, respectively) for comparison.
It is important to know how much MBT and its reaction products remain in the QD layer after patterning because the MBT residue can inhibit charge transport and affect QLED characteristics. To reveal this, we measured Fourier‐transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of a CdSe/Cd1−xZnxSe1−ySy/ZnS QD:MBT film at each patterning stage (Figure 2C). The UV irradiation caused negligible change in the IR spectrum of neat MBT (Figure S6A, Supporting Information) probably due to the little structural change upon photolysis. In QD:MBT samples, the MBT peaks were dominant at the formulation and UV irradiation stages (Figure 2C). However, most of the MBT peaks disappeared at the development stage, indicating that most MBT was washed away by toluene developer. This confirms that DOLFIN is a nearly residue‐free patterning process, which is required for manufacturing high‐quality QD EL displays. The bands at 1552 and 1073 cm−1 were assigned to the asymmetric stretching of zinc‐bound carboxylate group (νasym (COO)) and the stretching of zinc‐bound trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) (ν (P = O)), respectively.[13, 19] The IR absorption of oleates and TOPO were just marginally decreased after going through a complete patterning cycle (formulation, UV irradiation and development) (Figure S6B, Supporting Information); this shows that the stripping of organic ligands by the DOLFIN process was minimal.

The effect of incorporating PAGs on the optical properties of core/shell QDs was systematically investigated by measuring absorption, steady‐state PL, and PL lifetime of QD solutions upon adding PAGs and subsequent UV irradiation. The peak position and the linewidth of PL spectrum did not change with the addition of PAGs (2 wt%) and UV irradiation with a dose of ≈900 mJ cm−2 (Figure 3A; Figure S2B, Supporting Information). This indicates that the PAGs and their photolysis reactions do not affect the size and electronic structure of QDs. Also, we examined the PLQY of core/shell QD solutions and films at each patterning stage (Figure 3B; Figure S7A, Supporting Information). The QD solutions maintained ≈85% of initial PLQY after the PAG addition (formulation) and UV‐irradiation steps (for both MBT and DNS). The PLQY slightly decreased by 9%–10% and 6%–8% at the formulation and UV‐irradiation stages, respectively. The PLQY drop of PEN inks was considerably smaller than the drops in our previous DOLFIN methods (>40% at the formulation stage).[10-12] The high PLQY maintained after patterning is mainly attributed to the fact that this new DOLFIN method can use QDs with original organic ligands, unlike the previous DOLFIN methods. The development of patterns in toluene caused additional PLQY loss (e.g., from 58% to 51% for QD:MBT films); this was attributed to the loss of some bound organic ligands from the QD surface. In total, the patterned core/shell QD film was able to maintain ≈75% of initial PLQY, which can be a great advantage in patterning of QLEDs. Furthermore, time‐resolved PL measurement of PEN inks showed a slight decrease in average PL lifetime (from τavg = 18.3 ns to 16.2 ns) after the UV‐irradiation process (Figure S7B, Supporting Information), likely due to the generation of surface traps participating in nonradiative recombination as a result of photochemical reactions. The decrease in PLQY at the formulation stage was ascribed to the charge‐transfer quenching[20] and/or the surface traps generated by acidic impurities in commercial MBT. The above results show that PEN inks can be optically patterned with minimal impact on PLQY. It is reasonable to expect that further optimization of QD structure, ink formulation and patterning steps will enable near quantitative preservation of PLQY.

To demonstrate the patterning capability of the PEN inks, we fabricated a variety of QD patterns by using the RGB core/shell QDs. Figure 3C,D shows fluorescent CdSe/Cd1−xZnxSe1−ySy/ZnS QD patterns fabricated by using a green PEN ink with MBT of 3 wt%. We successfully demonstrated QD stripe patterns with various feature sizes ranging from 20 to 1.5 µm (Figure 3D; Figure S8, Supporting Information). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure S8E,F, Supporting Information) show a high contrast between UV‐exposed and unexposed regions with sharp edges; the line edge roughness was estimated to be <50 nm. These results show that the resolution of DOLFIN is limited by the projection optics, not by the PEN ink. RGB QD patterns were fabricated by using RGB PEN inks with 3 wt% MBT (Figure 3E), demonstrating applicability for various colloidal QDs. Our new DOLFIN method employs toluene as solvent for PEN inks as well as developer; this enables consecutive multiple patterning of QD layers in different colors (such as RGB). A dual‐color (red and green) flower pattern was successfully demonstrated by performing two repeated cycles of DOLFIN process (Figure S9, Supporting Information). Due to the photoinduced surface modification of QDs, the first‐deposited red QDs were able to retain the pattern without getting dissolved upon the subsequent patterning process of green QDs. These demonstrations prove that DOLFIN is a suitable method for consecutive patterning of vertical RGB QD multilayers (for white QLEDs) or lateral RGB QD sub‐pixels (for display panels).

We investigated the effect of DOLFIN on the morphology of QD films by comparing top‐view SEM images of two different CdSe/Cd1−xZnxSe1−ySy/ZnS QD films (a pristine film and a patterned film with 2 wt% MBT) (Figure 3F,G). Both QD films showed a similar uniform morphology, demonstrating that the DOLFIN process (i.e., formulation, UV irradiation and development) is non‐destructive. Also, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of QD patterns and their line profile (Figure 3H; Figure S8G,H, Supporting Information) clearly show that the DOLFIN method can yield well‐defined uniform patterns without any trace of capillary meniscus at the edges. The thicknesses of pristine and patterned QD films were the same (Figure S10, Supporting Information). We further optimized the PEN inks and the DOLFIN process to identify optimal patterning parameters such as the optimal amount of PAG additive, dose, excitation wavelength (See Figure S11, Text SG, Supporting Information).

To further demonstrate the potential of DOLFIN with PEN inks for patterning display pixels, we fabricated QD EL devices with CdSe/Cd1−xZnxSe1−ySy/ZnS QD EMLs patterned by DOLFIN. The device structure was ITO (145 nm)/Zn0.9Mg0.1O (50 nm)/QD (30–40 nm)/polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE) (10 nm)/poly(N,N′‐bis(4‐butylphenyl)‐N,N′‐bis(phenyl)‐benzidine (poly‐TPD) (30 nm)/MoOx (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) (Figure 4A). The Zn0.9Mg0.1O layers had a very uniform and flat surface morphology as shown in the SEM and AFM images (Figure S12A,B, Supporting Information). The energy levels of Zn0.9Mg0.1O and QD layers were determined using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and a Tauc plot (Figure S12C–F, Supporting Information), resulting in the schematic energy level diagram shown in Figure 4B. The vertical structure of the QLEDs was shown in a cross‐sectional SEM image (Figure 4C).

Current–voltage–luminance characteristics of the CdSe/Cd1−xZnxSe1−ySy/ZnS QLEDs are shown in Figure 4D–F, Figure S13 and Table S1, Supporting Information. To investigate the effects of each DOLFIN step (i.e., formulation, UV irradiation and develop), we prepared four different kinds of devices where the QD EMLs consist of: 1) pure QD (control, “pristine”), 2) QD:MBT (2 wt%, “formulation”), 3) QD:MBT with UV irradiation and 4) QD:MBT with UV irradiation and development (“patterned”). The turn‐on voltage (3.0 V, which corresponded to ≈0.01 cd m−2) did not change with DOLFIN steps (Figure 4E). The patterned QLED maintained ≈71% of maximum current efficiency (CEmax) of pristine QLED (Figure 4D). The CEmax of pristine QLED was 18.2 cd A−1 and it slightly decreased by 13% and 19%–27% in formulation and UV irradiation steps, respectively (Figure S13A, Supporting Information). The decreases were most likely due to the decreased PLQY of QD EML (Figure 3B). Assuming the Lambertian emission profile, the maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEmax) of the patterned and pristine QLEDs (with 2 wt% MBT) were 5.08% and 3.55%, respectively. The maximum luminance (Lmax ≈ 22 500 cd m−2) of patterned QLED was slightly lower but at a comparable level with the Lmax of pristine device (≈31 800 cd m−2) (Figure 4E). In addition, the EL spectra of the QLEDs were neither shifted nor broadened during the DOLFIN process (Figure 4F). The QLEDs patterned with DNS showed slightly larger drop in CEmax than the devices patterned with MBT due to the lower PLQY of patterned QD films but the Lmax was comparable (Figure S14, Supporting Information). We also demonstrated QLEDs with high‐resolution patterns as proof‐of‐concept devices. By using the same PEN ink containing CdSe/Cd1−xZnxSe1−ySy/ZnS QDs and MBT, grid or stripe patterned QLEDs with various feature sizes (5, 4, 2, and 1.5 µm) were fabricated (Figure 5A,B; Figure S15, Supporting Information). The patterned QLEDs showed high‐resolution green EL patterns, which were nearly identical to the PL patterns of the same patterned QD layers (Figure S15, Supporting Information). An EL pattern of the DOLFIN logo was also demonstrated (Figure 5C). Furthermore, we have patterned multicolor QLEDs with RGB pixels (Figure 5D) or alternating red and green pixels (Figure S16, Supporting Information) through the multicolor patterning scheme.

D) RGB‐patterned pixels at a high (left) and a low (right) brightness.
The presented photoinduced surface reaction, in situ ligand exchange in QD films, opens a direct, scalable, and nondestructive route for high‐resolution patterning of QDs and QLEDs. Also, this patterning method utilizes the infrastructure already established for conventional photolithography while allowing the exposure wavelength can be varied from deep UV (254 nm) to blue light (up to ≈450 nm). The use of long‐wavelength photons eliminates sample photodamage, elongates the light penetration depth into the patterning layer, and significantly reduces manufacturing costs associated with light source and focusing optics. At the same time, further research on the optimization of EQE and the long‐term behavior of patterned QLEDs will be necessary to successfully implement DOLFIN in display industry.

In conclusion, we have developed a viable solution to the currently unsolved problem of robust high‐resolution patterning of QD devices with minimal damage to QD luminescent properties. The introduction of “photopatternable emissive nanocrystal (PEN)” inks for the DOLFIN method enables a photoresist‐free optical patterning process generally compatible with QD EL devices. By using the in situ ligand exchange process, various high‐resolution RGB QD patterns were demonstrated with a uniform surface morphology and a small feature size (>1.5 µm) without damaging structural, electronic, and emissive properties of QD layers. This advanced patterning method can be implemented for various QD devices, such as transistors, hyperspectral IR sensors, lasers, wearable smart healthcare devices and other (opto)electronic components.

Detailed synthetic protocols are provided in the Supporting Information.

Patterning Process (DOLFIN Process)
PAG (either MBT or DNS) solutions were prepared by dissolving PAG powders in toluene (concentration = 10 mg mL−1). The QD solution was washed with acetone or ethanol twice and redispersed in toluene before adding PAG. A desired amount of the PAG solution (typically 1–3 wt%) was added to the colloidal QD solution (15 mg mL−1 in toluene) right before the spin‐coating process. Note that the weight percent was calculated based on the masses of QD and PAG. After spin‐coating the prepared PEN inks onto a substrate (2000 rpm for 40 s), the fabricated QD film was transferred to an optical enclosure equipped with LEDs for UV irradiation (365 or 405 nm). The dose was controlled by changing the duration of exposure while keeping the same power density (30 mW cm−2) and the distance between substrates and LEDs. Then, the QD film was developed in toluene for 10 s to lift off QDs from the unexposed areas of the substrate.

Fabrication of QLED
The prepared colloidal Zn0.9Mg0.1O nanocrystal solutions were spin‐coated (4500 rpm for 90 s) onto cleaned glass/ITO substrates pre‐treated with an oxygen plasma for 15 min. After spin‐coating, the Zn0.9Mg0.1O layers were immediately annealed on a hot plate at 200 °C for 1 h. The thickness of the prepared Zn0.9Mg0.1O layer was ≈50 nm. Then, the substrates were transferred in a glove box, and the prepared PEN inks were spin‐coated onto the ZnO (or Zn0.9Mg0.1O) layers to fabricate a QD:PAG layer of 30 nm thickness. Subsequently, PEIE (0.4 wt% in 2‐methoxyethanol) and poly‐TPD solutions (8 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) were spin‐coated (2000 rpm for 60 s) to fabricate layers of 10 and 30 nm, respectively. Then, the devices were transferred to a high‐vacuum thermal evaporator (an order of 10−7 Torr) to sequentially deposit MoOx (10 nm) and Al (100 nm) with deposition rates of 0.3 and 2.5 Å s−1. For patterned QLEDs, UV irradiation and development were followed by the spin‐coating of PEN inks. QLED characterization setup is described in the Supporting Information.
