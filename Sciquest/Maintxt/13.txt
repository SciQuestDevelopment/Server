Abstract: Solid‐state broadband light emitters in the visible have revolutionized today's lighting technology achieving compact footprints, flexible form factors, long lifetimes, and high energy saving, although their counterparts in the infrared are still in the development phase. To date, broadband emitters in the infrared have relied on phosphor‐downconverted light emitters based on atomic optical transitions in transition metal or rare earth elements in the phosphor layer resulting in limited spectral bandwidths in the near‐infrared and preventing their integration into electrically driven light‐emitting diodes (LEDs). Herein, phosphor‐converted LEDs based on engineered stacks of multi‐bandgap colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are reported as a novel class of broadband emitters covering a broad short‐wave infrared (SWIR) spectrum from 1050–1650 nm with a full‐width‐half‐maximum of 400 nm, delivering 14 mW of optical power with a quantum efficiency of 5.4% and power conversion efficiency of 13%. Leveraging the electrical conductivity of the CQD stacks, further, the first broadband SWIR‐active LED is demonstrated, paving the way toward complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor integrated broadband emitters for on‐chip spectrometers and low‐cost volume manufacturing. SWIR spectroscopy is employed to illustrate the practical relevance of the emitters in food and material identification case studies.

Main: Near‐infrared (NIR) and short‐wave infrared (SWIR) light emitters gain significant attention due to the widespread applications ranging from spectroscopy, 3D imaging, communications, surveillance, medical applications, just to name a few.[1-3] Recently, the use of NIR and SWIR spectroscopy is becoming an indispensable technique in food industry,[4] agriculture,[5] environmental,[6] pharmaceutical,[7] biological,[8] and medical sector[9] including noninvasive health monitoring. SWIR light sources offer unique advantages for highly sensitive detection of various organic and biological materials due to pronounced absorption of highly relevant elements (water, protein, lipid, etc.) in food, pharma, health, and product monitoring, characteristic of carbon‐hydrogen (CH) and oxygen‐hydrogen (OH) vibration.[10] Currently available broadband infrared light sources include tungsten halogen lamps, globars, and supercontinuum lasers that are used as the light source in spectrometers. Large size, low efficiency, high power consumption, cooling requirements as well as cost of those solutions currently impose roadblocks in the introduction of spectroscopy on consumer and Internet of Things (IoT) markets—where portable, low cost, silicon integrated, and miniaturized NIR and SWIR spectrometers are needed. Thus, it is of utmost importance to develop cost effective, portable, and complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS) compatible SWIR light sources to warrant volume manufacturing for compact and on‐chip spectroscopic applications. Cost‐effective phosphor‐based NIR downconverting light emitters known as phosphor‐converted light‐emitting diodes (pc‐LEDs) have been proposed to reduce the size of the light source.[11-14] The luminescence centers of the so‐far reported phosphor‐based glasses rely on transition metal or rare earth elements mainly utilizing Cr3+, Mn2+ or mixed Yb3+/Cr3+ luminescence centers,[15-19] developed to address the NIR spectrum. The fundamental challenges in electronic level modification for optical transitions in the SWIR and low stability have hindered the development of SWIR emitting pc‐LEDs with broadband and highly efficient emission.[20, 21] Here, we report a novel class of SWIR broadband thin‐film light‐emitter technology that simultaneously offers high efficiency, low cost, CMOS compatibility, and unprecedentedly broadband response across the SWIR exploiting a tandem multi‐bandgap colloidal quantum dot (CQD) stack.

To realize an efficient CQD downconverting broadband emitter, we have employed highly efficient emitting CQD solid‐state films comprising binary blends of lead sulfide (PbS) CQDs of high‐bandgap matrix dots and lower‐bandgap emitter dots with an optimized concentration to yield photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in excess of 60%.[22] The matrix dots serve to absorb visible light strongly, that in turns funnels the photogenerated carriers to the emitter dots for efficient SWIR light emission. Figure 1a shows the schematic of the QD‐based downconverter. We have used a commercially available AlGaInP light‐emitting diode (LED) as the visible light source (λem = 595 nm) and ligand‐treated CQD arrays as the solid‐state downconverting material. The downconverting QD film is deposited via spin‐coating on a flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrate (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The emission spectrum for a downconverting film based on an emission wavelength of 1.4 μm is shown in Figure S2b, Supporting Information. To achieve broadband emission, we have constructed the downconverting film by placing three binary CQD blend layers with the same matrix layer (λex = 0.7 µm) and different emitter QDs from shorter to longer emission wavelength (λex = 1.25, 1.4, 1.55 µm, respectively) as shown in Figure 1b. The thicknesses of the different layers are optimized to obtain a nearly uniform spectrum (S3, Supporting Information). Figure 1c shows the spectral coverage of the SWIR broadband emitters from 1050 to 1650 nm with an average full‐width‐half‐maximum (FWHM) of ≈400 nm as a function of LED driving current. To our knowledge, this is the broadest FWHM based downconverter reported in the SWIR region with high power spectral density. Moreover, the system offers high spectral stability with increasing driving current, of high importance for spectroscopy applications. Figure 1d shows the emission performance of the broadband downconverting film. The devices exhibit integrated infrared emission ≈14 mW with a LED driving current of 360 mA. The EQE (defined as the ratio of infrared photon output to the injected charge carriers to the device) of the downconverting system reaches ≈5.4% when measured at 1.4 µm. The photon conversion efficiency (defined as the fraction of emitted infrared photons over the absorbed visible photons) is as high as ≈27% with LED driving current of 360 mA. The power conversion efficiency of the pc‐LED, defined as the fraction of emitted optical power to the input electrical power reached 13% (Figure S5a, Supporting Information). To our knowledge, these parameters are the best reported so far for broadband SWIR emitters.

Visible to infrared broadband downconverting film and SWIR performance: a) Schematic of visible to SWIR optical downconversion procedure using a downconverting film based on colloidal PbS QDs. b) Schematic of the broadband downconverting QD structure. The downconverting layer consists of three different layers. Each of the layers consists of two different types of QDs (matrix and emitter QDs, respectively). For all the active layers, matrix remains same (λex = 0.7 µm QDs). The emitter QDs changes according to emission wavelength smaller to longer (1.25, 1.4, and 1.55 µm, respectively). c) Emission spectra of the colloidal PbS‐QD‐based downconverting emitters as a function of increasing applied current. Combining different emitters in the SWIR region gives high FWHM of nearly 400 nm with a spectral coverage from 1050 to 1650 nm. Spectral evolution of the emission shows almost stable spectra with the range of applied current. d) Emitted infrared power, EQE (measured at 1400 nm) and photon conversion efficiency (visible to infrared) as a function of LED driving current. The emitted IR power goes to as high as 14 mW and peak EQE of 5.4% with a reasonably significant visible to IR photon conversion efficiency of 27%.
Unlike the downconverting phosphor glasses based on transition metal/rare earth elements, ligand‐treated PbS CQD blends are electrically conductive and have demonstrated compelling performance as LEDs.[22-24] We leveraged this feature to develop herein the first electrically driven broadband SWIR LED. In doing so, we first considered the possibility of mixing all sizes of emitter dots in the matrix (Figure 2a), following prior art on white light emission CQD LEDs.[25-27] By mixing all three emitter QDs (λex = 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 µm, respectively) in the matrix QD of λex = 0.7 µm the resultant emission spectrum, shown in Figure 2c, failed to deliver broadband emission. The EL spectrum showed instead a strong peak around 1.5 µm. This suggests that charge funneling to the smaller bandgap emitter CQDs is taking place preventing thus equally efficient emission from all the emitter CQDs (Figure 2b). This was further corroborated by fabricating LEDs whose active layer consisted solely of emitter QDs as shown in S5 in the Supporting Information. The emission shows similar characteristics with a strong emission around 1.5 µm (Figure S6b, Supporting Information). This strengthens our hypothesis of majority charge injection to the lowest bandgap QDs. To realize a broadband PbS CQD LED it is thus necessary to confine the radiative charge recombination in each of the emitter layers of different bandgaps. Figure 2d shows the schematic of the LED devices with three active layers of which each consists the common matrix of λex = 0.7 µm and emitters from higher bandgap to lower bandgap respectively from the electron injection side of the device. The reverse order of emitter QDs does not work due to photon reabsorption as shown in Figure S7 in the Supporting Information. The energetic band diagram of the LED device is shown in Figure 2e. The carriers supplied to the confined emitters in each active layer recombine radiatively with negligible charge transfer occurring in‐between emitters of different bandgaps. The emission spectra of the optimized broadband LED are shown in Figure 2f. The efficacy of the selected bandgap matrix QDs and the surface passivation of the employed hybrid ligand moieties is demonstrated in single bandgap LEDs comprising individually the selected emitter QDs of the broadband LED, as demonstrated in S7 in the Supporting Information. The shape of the spectrum does not change significantly with applied voltage as shown in spectral stability analysis in Figure S8 in the Supporting Information. The spectral coverage and FWHM of the emitted spectra depend on the choice of emitter QDs bandgap and the number of active layers. Figure 3a shows the difference in emission spectra between devices based on three and four active layers. The four‐active‐layer‐based device demonstrates further increased FWHM of 354 nm compared to the FWHM of 246 nm of the three‐active‐layer‐based LEDs. Although four active layer devices exhibits better spectral coverage and FWHM, it yields lower radiance compared to the three‐layer‐based devices (Figure 3b), due to lower charge injection (Figure S9, Supporting Information) and the possibility of more imbalanced charge supply to each of the layers. The radiance of the three layer devices reaches 15 W m−2 sr−1 at the applied voltage of 5 V compared to 5 W m−2 sr−1 of four layer devices. The three layer devices show similar radiance as reported for single emission mixed QD binary devices for similar active layer thickness.[22] As a consequence of the higher radiance for three layer device, it shows higher peak EQE of 5.2% compared to 3.9% of four layer device (measured at 1400 nm). This is the first ever reported CQD‐based broadband LED emitting in the SWIR region with extended FWHM and device performance on par with state‐of‐the‐art, narrowband SWIR LEDs comprising single‐bandgap CQD‐based active layers.

Finally, we demonstrate the practical relevance of our technology as a broadband SWIR light source in a prototype home built infrared spectrometer enabling the identification of chemicals, food and materials in a real‐world setting. The schematic of the spectrometer is shown in Figure 4a. The shape and intensity of the source spectrum was unchanged throughout the course of the measurements. We have chosen three commercially relevant examples that require broadband SWIR spectroscopy to highlight the practical importance of our emitters. Plastic sorting is an important environmental challenge to separate different type of plastics for the recycling purposes. SWIR spectroscopy can be used to separate different plastics from its transmittance or reflectance spectra. The absorption bands for different plastics occur in SWIR region due to the fundamental CH or OH vibration bands or overtones.[28, 29] Figure 4b shows the transmittance spectra of different plastic samples namely, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), PS (polystyrene), low‐density polyethylene (LDPE), high‐density polyethylene (HDPE), and polypropylene (PP) acquired with our spectrometer. Although some of the vibration bands overlap for different samples, clear spectral differences observed for the samples under testing. In a similar fashion operating with liquid samples, different solvents can be identified.[30] Water, ethanol, and toluene are transparent in the visible region but they have distinct spectral signatures in the infrared (1450 nm) due to the difference in OH vibration strength as shown in Figure 4c. Further, we present its application in food industry to distinguish the animal milk from vegetable‐based milk. The difference in light scattering coefficient[31, 32] in the infrared range of 1100–1300 nm allows to distinguish the different types of milk (cow, almond, rice, and oat) by measuring their transmittance across the SWIR (Figure 4d).

Ethanol, toluene, and water showed distinct differences in infrared that is absence in visible range. d) Distinction of animal milk from different types of plant‐based milk. Clear distinction is observed in the obtained spectra of cow's milk and oat‐, rice‐, and almond‐based milk.
In summary, we have demonstrated a simple, cost‐effective CQD‐based downconversion device for broadband SWIR emission with FWHM as high as 400 nm and high emitted IR power (S10 in the Supporting Information). Moreover, in contrast to previously considered phosphor‐based materials, CQDs enable their integration into active LED devices with 5.2% EQE. The use of CQDs enables tunable spectral shape and coverage by selecting the emitter QD bandgap unlike traditional phosphor‐based systems in which the spectra depend on the luminescence center, electronic configuration, and crystal field strength. Our work addresses the light‐source challenge towards efficient, low‐cost, compact, silicon integrated miniaturized SWIR spectrometers and advanced multispectral imaging systems.

Experimental Section: PbS Quantum Dot Synthesis
700 nm excitonic peak based PbS QDs, used as the matrix materials for the devices, were synthesized using the Schlenk technique following the standard recipe. Briefly, 0.446 g (2 mmol) lead oxide (PbO), 1.6 mL (4.7 mmol) oleic acid, and 18 mL 1‐octadecene (ODE) were pumped overnight at 90 °C. The temperature was reset to 80 °C and 1 mmol hexamethyldisilane (HMS) mixed with 5 mL ODE was immediately injected. The reaction was quenched with cold acetone after 20 s and the QDs were isolated by precipitation. The QDs were further purified by dispersion/precipitation with toluene/acetone 3 times.

1300 nm excitonic peak based PbS QDs were synthesized by a previously reported multi‐injection method with slight modification.[33] Typically, 0.446 g (2 mmol) PbO, 3.8 mL oleic acid, and 50 mL ODE were mixed together at 90 °C under vacuum overnight. Once under Ar atmosphere, the temperature was raised to 100 °C and a solution of 0.43 mmol HMS in 3 mL ODE was quickly injected. After 6 min, a second solution of 0.31 mmol HMS in 9 mL ODE was dropwise injected in a rate of 0.75 mL min−1 and then, the heating was stopped immediately and the solution was cooled down gradually to room temperature. The QDs were purified three times with a mixture of acetone/ethanol, redispersing with toluene. For the synthesis of 1250 nm excitonic peak based PbS QDs, the reaction temperature was set to 90 °C. 1400 and 1500 nm excitonic peak based PbS were synthesized following the same method (reaction temperature 100 °C), but using 0.33 mmol HMS in the first injection and 0.33 and 0.43 mmol HMS in the second injection, respectively. The final concentration of all the PbS QD solutions were adjusted to 30 mg mL−1 before the LED device preparation.

CQD‐Based Downconverting Film Preparation
CQD‐based downconverting films were prepared on top of commercially purchased flexible PET substrate. PET substrates were cleaned rinsing in isopropyl alcohol and then dried in nitrogen flow. Ligand‐treated QD films were deposited on the substrate as described in our previous report.[34] The matrix and emitter QDs were prepared in separate vials with similar concentrations (30 mg mL−1). For preparing binary blends, emitter PbS QDs were mixed in the 700 nm PbS matrix QDs as 7.5% solution volume mixing ratio that showed optimum device performance through maximizing PLQY and charge‐balance.[22, 35] ZnI2 and 3‐mercaptopropionic acid (MPA)‐ based mixed ligand was used for the solid‐state QD film formation. For deposition, the binary QD solution was cast on top of the substrate before spinning with rpm of 2000 for 15 s. Then the spinning was stopped to treat the film with aforementioned mixed ligand for 5 s. After that, the substrate was immediately spun and cleaned with few drops of methanol and dried for further 10 s. The procedure was repeated 18 times to obtain optimized thickness of (≈350 nm). For broadband downconverter, the binary layers were deposited in a sequence of higher bandgap emitters to lower bandgap emitters respectively from the substrate. The thicknesses of the different layers were varied according to the optimized photon absorption. Commercially purchased InGaInP LED emitting at 595 nm (LED595LW‐Thorlab) was used as the source LED for visible to SWIR downconversion.

LED Device Preparation
LEDs were prepared on pre‐cleaned ITO coated glass as described in our previous report.[22] ZnO NCs in chloroform (40 mg mL−1) was spun on top of the substrate with a spin speed of 4000 rpm to form the electron injection layer and thereafter annealed at 250 °C for 30 min. The active layer was deposited on top of the ZnO layer as described in the downconverting film preparation section. The thickness of the active layer was adjusted as ≈60 nm for three layers devices. For broadband devices, the emitters of the mixed layers varied form higher bandgap to lower bandgap, respectively. The hole‐transporting layer of ≈50 nm was formed by using the PbS QDs (similar to the matrix QDs) treated with 0.02% EDT (1,2 ethane di thiol) in acetonitrile solution. The top electrode was formed by thermally evaporated Au deposition (Nano 36 Kurt J. Lesker) through a pre‐patterned circular shadow mask with hole diameter of 2 mm at a base pressure of 10−6 mbar.

LED Performance Characterization
Both the downconverting films as well as the LED devices were formed and characterized in ambient condition. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded using a computer‐controlled Keithley 2400 source measurement unit. EQE of the devices were calculated by detecting the radiance from the device with a calibrated Newport 918D‐IR‐OD3 germanium photodetector connected to Newport 1918‐C power meter in parallel to the J–V measurements and further confirmed with a Newport 818 IG InGaAs photodetector. For broadband emission, the power was detected at 1400 nm and normalized for the whole spectra according to the responsivity of the photodetector. Newport 818‐UV silicon detector was used to detect the emission from the purchased 595 nm LED source. Lambertian emission was assumed. The thickness of the glass substrate was taken into account during the solid angle calculation. Electroluminescence spectra were taken using ANDOR InGaAs array CCD camera (Kymera 328i). The voltage bias to the QD‐based LED devices for electroluminescence measurement was applied with a Keithley 2400 source meter. For downconverting films, the high driving current to the LED was applied with Aim TTi international DC power source (PLH 250).

Spectroscopic Characterizations
In house SWIR spectroscope was built using the CQD‐based SWIR light sources. ANDOR InGaAs array CCD camera (Kymera 328i) was used as the detector. The samples were placed in between the source and the detector. The transmittance spectra were calibrated by normalizing the source spectrum. The spectral shape remained nearly unchanged throughout the course of measurements.
