Abstract: Low‐symmetry 2D materials with unique anisotropic optical and optoelectronic characteristics have attracted a lot of interest in fundamental research and manufacturing of novel optoelectronic devices. Exploring new and low‐symmetry narrow‐bandgap 2D materials will be rewarding for the development of nanoelectronics and nano‐optoelectronics. Herein, sulfide niobium (NbS3), a novel transition metal trichalcogenide semiconductor with low‐symmetry structure, is introduced into a narrowband 2D material with strong anisotropic physical properties both experimentally and theoretically. The indirect bandgap of NbS3 with highly anisotropic band structures slowly decreases from 0.42 eV (monolayer) to 0.26 eV (bulk). Moreover, NbS3 Schottky photodetectors have excellent photoelectric performance, which enables fast photoresponse (11.6 µs), low specific noise current (4.6 × 10−25 A2 Hz−1), photoelectrical dichroic ratio (1.84) and high‐quality reflective polarization imaging (637 nm and 830 nm). A room‐temperature specific detectivity exceeding 107 Jones can be obtained at the wavelength of 3 µm. These excellent unique characteristics will make low‐symmetry narrow‐bandgap 2D materials become highly competitive candidates for future anisotropic optical investigations and mid‐infrared optoelectronic applications.

Main: Mid‐wavelength infrared (MWIR) photodetectors are associated with significant applications such as infrared polarization imaging,[1] remote sensing,[2] free space telecommunications,[3] IR spectroscopy[4] and lidar,[5] which is of particular scientific significance and technical guidance for infrared physics technology. Traditional MWIR photodetectors including indium antimonide (InSb),[6] mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe)[7] and quantum‐well structures based on group III to V materials,[8] face some major challenges. MWIR photodetectors based on traditional materials not only involves complex and toxic growth processes,[9] but also work under low‐temperature conditions,[10] which is difficult to meet the requirements for low‐cost and portable instruments.

Due to atomic layer thickness, high mobility, adjustable bandgap, and high chemical stability, various narrow‐bandgap 2D materials, such as graphene,[11, 12] noble metal dichalcogenides (Pd, Pt),[13, 14] black phosphorus (BP),[15, 16] and black arsenic phosphorus (b‐AsP)[17] have attracted wide attention and been extensively investigated. Graphene, which possesses zero‐bandgap or small bandgap modulated by chemical doping, provides a promising alternative solution for MWIR and long‐wavelength infrared (LWIR) photodetectors.[18] However, the low photoabsorption and high dark current of graphene photodetectors result in high noise, lower responsivity and detectivity, which make graphene difficult to practical application.[19, 20] Noble metal dichalcogenides with high mobility and air stability[13, 21] exhibit sensitivity under MWIR and LWIR illumination at room temperature. However, the interlayer force of the noble metal dichalcogenide is very strong, and obtaining a few layers by mechanical exfoliation is hard. These materials are more semi‐metallic and the dark current of the devices is larger as the thickness increases. It is noteworthy that few‐layered BP photodetectors with a bandgap of ≈0.3 eV have exhibited high photoresponsivity (10 A W−1) and detectivity (1010 Jones) in the MWIR range.[22] On the other hand, the bandgap of BP alloyed with increasing arsenide could be adjusted from ≈0.3 to ≈0.15 eV. The response spectrum of b‐AsP photodetectors extends the LWIR.[17, 23] Due to the pleated low‐symmetry structure, BP has good in‐plane anisotropy. This unique physical characteristic makes it very suitable for polarization‐sensitive MWIR photodetectors.[24] Unfortunately, the poor air‐stability[25] and large‐scale synthesis[26] of BP severely limit the great improvement of BP photodetectors and further hinder electronic and optoelectronic applications. Thus, exploring new materials with low‐symmetry for MWIR photodetectors with low dark current and fast response is a large challenge.

Here, we have introduced a novel low‐symmetric layered NbS3 that demonstrated its in‐plane structure, phonon vibration, electrical and optical anisotropies. The obtained optical bandgap of NbS3 is 0.3 eV and slowly decreases from 0.42 eV (monolayer) to 0.26 eV (bulk) calculated by first‐principle calculations. The NbS3 Schottky photodetectors exhibit broadband detection sensitivity (400–10 600 nm), excellent response time (as fast as 11 µs), photoelectrical dichroic ratio (1.84) and high‐quality polarization imaging. Moreover, the devices could achieve specific room‐temperature detection sensitivity higher than 107 Jones under 3 µm illumination. Additionally, the photovoltaic effect (PVE) of the NbS3 devices is dominant at visible to near‐infrared and the photobolometric effect (PBE) is dominant at MWIR and LWIR. Our study opens an avenue for novel low‐symmetry 2D materials and high‐performance MWIR optoelectronics.

The crystal structure of bulk NbS3 belongs to the triclinic system, and the space group P‐1 (a = 0.496 nm, b = 0.673 nm, c = 0.914 nm, β = 97.17°, and α = γ = 90°.).[27-29] As shown in Figure 1a–d, NbS3 structure with different three‐dimensional views can be concluded that NbS3 is a layered material (more perspective information could be found in Note S1, Supporting Information). It is worthy that NbS3 with the low in‐plane lattice symmetry exhibits anisotropic properties, which is different from TMDs (MoS2, MoSe2, PtSe2).[30-32] NbS3 crystals were synthesized using chemical vapor transport (CVT) (Figure S2a, Supporting Information, more information could be seen in the Experimental Section). The grown crystals are nanofibrous with a metallic luster and the average length is ≈10 mm (Figure S2b, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 1e, the high‐resolution electron microscopy (HR‐TEM) image shows that the lattice spacing of the (001) plane was 0.436 nm, which is consistent with previous research.[27, 29] The lattice fringes indicated in Fourier transform image (Figure 1f) are labeled (01–1), (11–1), and (100), respectively. The triclinic crystal structure of the grown single crystal can be demonstrated. Figure 1g,h shows the energy‐dispersive X‐ray microscopy (EDX) mapping of 2D NbS3, showing the uniform spatial distribution of Nb and S. Meanwhile, the obtained atomic ratio of Nb and S is ≈1: 3 (Figure S2c, Supporting Information). Besides, X‐ray diffraction (XRD) was applied to identify the crystal phase of the NbS3. Three main peaks located at 10°, 19.8°, and 40° are the (001), (002), and (004) planes, respectively. These results suggest that the NbS3 crystals have a (001) preferred growth orientation and the FWHM of 0.2° indicates high single crystallinity. Additionally, according to formula 2dsinθ = nλ, where d, θ and n are layer distance, the X‐ray incident angle and the magnitude of the Bragg peak, respectively. The wavelength of the X‐ray (λ) is 0.154 nm. The obtained d of NbS3 is ≈0.882 nm from the first peak (Figure 1i). Meanwhile, the c‐axis of the unit cell composed of two layers forms a 107° angle with the base plane for this triclinic crystal structure. Therefore, h = 2d/sin97.19° = 1.778 nm. Six Raman peaks of NbS3 flakes (Figure 1j) located at ≈151, ≈159, ≈196, ≈263, 340, and 391 cm−1, correspond to the (T'y) mode, ν(NbNb) stretching mode, ν(Nb(S2)2−), NbS vibrations, ν(NbS2−) intrachain vibration, and ν(NbS2−) interchain modes, respectively, which is in agreement with the reported work.[27] In addition, the Nb2p core spectrum in Figure 1k characterized by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that two strong peaks are located at 206.2 and 203.4 eV, which correspond to the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 states of Nb, respectively. At the same time, the binding energies of the S' 2p1/2, S' 2p3/2, and S 2p1/2, S 2p3/2 states are observed in the S 2p core spectrum, which are 163, 161.9 and 161.9, 160.8 eV, respectively. Two strong peaks are located at 206.7 and 209.2 eV corresponding to Nb 3d5/2 and Nb 3d3/2 of Nb2O5 due to the surface oxidation.

Low‐symmetry of the NbS3 crystal structure indicates that its phonon vibration should be anisotropic. Anisotropic optical properties of 100 nm NbS3 are further characterized by angular‐resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy (Figure 2a and Figure S3a, Supporting Information). By rotating the 1/2 wave plate in 30° steps, the angle‐resolved Raman peak can be observed at a variation period of 180° with maximum values (Figure 2b). The peak intensities of different modes are extracted by fitting the trigonometric function, α(φ) = αmax·cos2(π·φ/360 − π) + αmin·sin2(π·φ/360 − π), where φ is the incident polarization angle, αmax and αmin are the values of the maximum and minimum intensity, respectively (Figure 2c and Figure S3b–f, Supporting Information).[33, 34] More specifically, Raman peaks of 196 cm−1 for the 2D NbS3 flake shows the maximum intensity at 0° and 180° along the (001) plane. The main Raman peaks are significantly higher in the parallel (VV) direction than in the cross‐polarization channels (VH) direction (Figure 2d), and the ratios (VH/VV) of each peak are 0.36, 0.31, 0.35, 0.39, 0.41, and 0.55, respectively (Figure 2d).[35] The ratio is closer to 0.75, indicating that the polarization characteristics of scattered radiation are stronger and NbS3 has significant anisotropic characteristics. A typical azimuth‐dependent reflectance difference microscopy (ADRDM) measurement of a 2D NbS3 flakes (Figure S4, Supporting Information) further demonstrates the in‐plane anisotropic optical reflection.[36] The reflection intensity on 2D NbS3 flakes presents a minimum value of 90° and 270° (dark yellow), and a maximum value of 0° and 180° (yellow), demonstrating the large in‐plane optical reflection of NbS3 flakes.

We further investigated the spectral photoresponse of NbS3 in the MWIR spectral range. The infrared photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of the NbS3 sample exhibits a peak at 3560 nm (corresponding to ≈0.35 eV) (Figure 2e), which is possibly related to the direct exciton transition and also similar to that of MoS2.[37] The infrared photoabsorption spectrum of the 2D NbS3 flake is used to further confirm the bandgap. The infrared absorption peaks located at ≈2937 and 2864 cm−1 show the bandgap is about 0.36 and 0.35 eV, which is consistent with the results of PL characterization, as shown in Figure 2f. As the wavenumber decreases from the peak, the absorption decreases linearly to ≈2430 cm−1, corresponding absorption edge to ≈0.3 eV. Besides, the energy band structures of monolayer, bilayer and bulk NbS3 calculated from first‐principle calculations are shown in Figure 2h–j, indicating that the indirect bandgap of NbS3 with semiconductor properties slowly decreases from 0.42 eV (monolayer) to 0.26 eV (bulk), which is close to the spectral photoresponse bandgap. For monolayer NbS3, the  𝑚CBM−Γh  and  𝑚CBM−Yh  are 4.379m0 and 4.59m0, larger than that of bilayer NbS3 (3.149m0 and 3.142m0). The  𝑚VBM−Γe  and  𝑚VBM−Xe  are 0.265m0 and 0.257m0, but also smaller than that of bilayer NbS3 (0.277m0 and 0.559m0). These results elucidate that the effective mass of the carrier remains highly anisotropic as the number of atomic layers increases, similar to BP and GeP.[34, 38] On the other hand, there is a single high‐energy direct exciton transition at the place pointed by the green arrow (Figure 2j), corresponding to the position of the infrared PL peak.

Due to low‐symmetry and narrow‐bandgap, NbS3 has exhibited a promising potential in polarization‐sensitive infrared photodetectors. NbS3 field‐effect transistors (FET) were fabricated on a SiO2/Si substrate. An on‐off current ratio (≈104) and favorable electron field‐effect mobility (6.87 cm2 V−1 s−1) are achieved (Figure S5a and Note S1, Supporting Information). The optoelectronic properties of the NbS3 FET can be found in Figures S5 and S6 (Supporting Information). To suppress dark current noise, an NbS3 Schottky photodetector is fabricated by using 2D NbS3 flakes sandwiched between the top Cr electrode and the bottom Au electrode. Due to the block part of the light by Cr electrode, a comb‐like Cr electrode is used to increase the photoabsorption area (Figure 3a, see the Experimental Section for more information). The NbS3 Schottky photodetector consists of the geometry of the Schottky contact and the asymmetric contact of the electrodes constitute due to the work function difference of Au (5.1 eV) and Cr (4.5 eV).[39] The AFM image and height profile of the NbS3 Schottky photodetector is shown in Figure S7a,b (Supporting Information). The considerable current rectification ratio (i.e., forward/reverse current ratio, IF/IR≈500) is achieved at |Vds| = 1 V, demonstrated that there exists an obvious Schottky junction (Figure S7c, Supporting information).[40] To demonstrate the photoresponse mechanism of the device, the photocurrent generation position of the device is mapped by scanning photocurrent microscopy at Vds = 0 V (Figure 3b). The photoresponse is observed in the overlapped region of Cr and NbS3, indicating an effective Schottky junction formed between Cr and NbS3.[41, 42] Figure 3c shows the current–voltage (Ids–Vds) curve of the NbS3 Schottky photodetector measured in the dark condition and under 830 nm light with various optical power densities. The NbS3 Schottky photodetector exhibits an excellent PVE. The generated photocurrent increases with increasing incident powers. When the power density varies from 7.72 to 3343.63 µW µm−2, the photocurrent increases from 5.6 × 10−8 to 1.58 × 10−6 A. A high photoswitching (Ilight/Idark ≈ 105) is obtained under 3243.63 mW mm−2, demonstrating excellent signal‐to‐noise ratio of the device. The power‐law (Iph ∼ Pα) fits the power‐dependent photoresponse (Figure 3d), where Iph is the net photocurrent, P is the effective illuminated power of the device. The results of sublinear fitting (α = 0.66) suggest that the light interaction of NbS3 photodetectors is the complex process of electron‐hole generation, trapping, and recombination.[43-45] Additionally, responsivity (R) and specific detectivity (D*) are the critical parameter indicators applied to evaluate the performance of photodetectors. The obtained maximum photoresponsivity of NbS3 photodetectors at 830 nm is 24.7 mA W−1, through the equation of R = Iph/(P S), where S is the effective light sensitivity area of the device (Figure 3f). Specific detectivity is expressed by D* = (SΔf)1/2R(in)−1/2, Δf and in represents the electrical bandwidth and represents the equivalent noise current, respectively (≈4.6 × 10−25 A2 Hz−1) (Figure 3e). D* is achieved by 5.7 × 108 Jones (Figure 3f). The high detectivity of the photodetector depends on maximizing the signal‐to‐noise ratio in the zero‐bias mode.[46] On the other hand, Figure 3h shows that the rising and falling times of the device are 11.6 and 9.4 µs, respectively, which is faster than most Schottky photodetectors in the near‐infrared (NIR) band, shown in Table 1. Furthermore, the photoresponsivity, detectivity, and response time at different wavelengths of the device were obtained, shown in Figure 3i,j and Figure S9 (Supporting Information). It can be found that the device has the fastest response time at 830 nm, indicating that the device has different photoresponse processes under different light illuminations. The response time of the visible band is slowed down mainly due to the effect of defect states, which has been reported in many 2D materials.[13, 47, 48]

To further research the influencing factors of the response time of the NbS3 device in different wavebands, the MWIR and LWIR photocurrents analysis is performed on the device at a bias of 1 V. Figure 4a shows a fast response time of the device during the initial rising process (less than <50 ms). Then, the photocurrent increases slowly (>20 s). The slope of the current curve decreases with time (from 28.5 to 3.9 nA s−1) until it reaches saturation. After removing the laser, the current first falls steeply and then gradually decreases until the original dark current level is restored (see Figure S12a, Supporting Information). To further prove that the response time is less than 50 ms due to the photoconductive effect (PCE), we conducted photocurrent tests at different modulation frequencies. Photocurrent does not change with the modulation frequency in the measurement range (up to 20 kHz) for PCE. Therefore, the fast process possibly is the contribution due to the PCE, and the slow process possibly is the contribution due to the PBE.[49] The falling time response of the photocurrent at 10 600 nm beyond the absorption edge of NbS3 material is shown in Figure 4b. It was found that during the overall rising process, the current increased slowly (>20 s), and there was no steep saturation during the rising and decaying process (Figure S4b, Supporting Information). It is shown that the photoresponse mechanism in the 10 600 nm band is the PBE.

Inset: The specific R of NbS3 Schottky photodetector under different wavelengths from MWIR to LWIR.
Therefore, the phenomena observed are mainly caused by PVE, PCE, and PBE.[15, 50] Meanwhile, defect states of the 2D NbS3 flakes also affect on the response time. From visible to NIR ranges, electron‐hole pairs are separated by a built‐in electric field in the space charge region and gather on the electrode to generate current, with main contributions of PVE (Figure S10, Supporting Information). The photoresponse time of the device is mainly affected by the defect state. The longer the wavelength, the weaker the effect of the defect state on response time (Figure 3j). In the MWIR ranges, not only the separation of electron‐hole pairs, but the main contribution comes from PBE, which is based on temperature‐induced hot carriers or hot electrons (Figure 4c).[51-53] Irradiation of light on the device causes the temperature to rise, which leads to the increase of carriers, thereby increasing the induced conductivity. In the LWIR band (10 600 nm), beyond the photoabsorption wavelength of NbS3, the change of photocurrent is attributed to PBE (Figure 4d). Additionally, the R (2.49 A W−1) and D* (4.78 × 107 Jones) of NbS3 photodetectors are obtained under 3098 nm laser illumination (Figure 4e,f). Moreover, the NbS3 Schottky photodetector has a good performance compared to that of narrow‐bandgap 2D photodetectors shown in Table 1. The air‐stability for narrow bandgap 2D semiconductors (such as BP and b‐AsP) has always been a major challenge. Therefore, the air‐stability of the NbS3 FET and NbS3 Schottky photodetector was investigated by placing samples in air for several months. Still, the photocurrent is basically no degradation (Figure S13, Supporting Information), indicated NbS3 is a very stable infrared narrow‐bandgap material.

To further investigate the photoresponse polarization characteristic of the device, the polarized measurement of NbS3 photodetector is shown in Figure S14a (Supporting Information). The measured photocurrents under 637 and 830 nm laser illumination with different excitation polarization angles are shown in Figure 5a,b. Similar to the angle‐resolved Raman, the photocurrent also presents sinusoidal dependence on the incident polarization angle (φ) and can be fitted results using the trigonometric function: Iph(φ) = Imax·cos2(π·φ/360 − π) + Imin·sin2(π·φ/360 − π), where the Imax and Imin represent the maximum and minimum photocurrent, respectively. Photoelectrical dichroic ratio (DR) is an important index describing polarization performance, defined as DR (λ) = Imax(λ)/Imin(λ), where Imax(λ) and Imin(λ) are the maximum and minimum photocurrent at the wavelength of λ, respectively. The DR (637 nm) and DR (830 nm) are up to 3.95 and 1.84, respectively. The device also has good optical polarization at 1060, 1310, and 3098 nm (Figure S14b–d, Supporting Information), which indicates the anisotropic photoresponse similar to 2D GeSe2,[65] GeP[66] and BP.[67] These results confirm the presence of orientation‐dependent photoabsorption and well reveal the anisotropy in NbS3, which is caused by the low symmetry of the triclinic NbS3. Due to the excellent polarization photoelectric performance of the device, a single‐pixel reflective polarization imaging of NbS3 photodetector was performed (Figure S16a, Supporting Information).[1, 67] The imaging target is an Au pattern obtained by electron beam lithography and thermal evaporation (Figure S16b,c, Supporting Information). Figure 5c shows polarization‐dependent visible images measured at 637 nm illumination at 0° and 90° polarization angles, respectively. At a 0° polarization angle, a high‐resolution “SITP” image (upper side of Figure 5c) was taken with a high photocurrent contrast of 3.6 µA, and the polarization angle of the image with a comparative photocurrent contrast of 1.2 µA was 90° (lower side of Figure 5c). A photoelectrical dichroic ratio exceeding 3 is achieved, revealing the excellent polarized light imaging ability of the NbS3 device. On the other hand, near‐infrared polarized imaging based on NbS3 photodetector is realized. As shown in Figure 5d, the image of the English letter “INFRARED FUDAN NBS3” can be clearly recognized under the illumination of 830 nm. Meanwhile, the image has a photoelectrical dichroic ratio of 1.5. These results demonstrate the great potential of NbS3‐based photodetectors in polarization‐sensitive broadband photoelectric detection and imaging.

In summary, we have introduced novel 2D anisotropic NbS3 into the material family by demonstrating its in‐plane structure, phonon vibrations, and electrical and optical anisotropies. We also demonstrated a polarization‐sensitive MWIR photodetector. The obtained optical bandgap of NbS3 is 0.3 eV and slowly decreases from 0.42 eV (monolayer) to 0.26 eV (bulk) calculated by first‐principle calculations. NbS3 photodetectors exhibit a broad spectrum photoresponse, fast response time, good air stability, and high specific detectivity at room temperature. In addition, a high linearly dichroic ratio (3.95 and 1.84) and high‐quality polarization images are obtained from a NbS3 photodetector at 637 and 830 nm, respectively. Our work not only provides a promising new narrowband 2D material of NbS3 for manufacturing novel optoelectronics but also provides basic information about its anisotropy, which may stimulate future study on 2D trichalcogenides.

Experimental Section: Synthesis of NbS3 Nanoplates
The synthesis of NbS3 single crystals was acquired via a chemical vapor transport (CVT) method. First, high‐purity Nb powder (99.95%) and S (99.999%) were purchased powder from Alfa Aesar. The mixture of Nb/S atomic ratio Nb/S = 1: 3.3 (1.87 g, 2.13 g) was sealed in a vacuum quartz tube at 10−4 Pa. The tube sealing process was completed by a hydrogen‐oxygen machine and placed a quartz tube in a tube furnace, slowly heated to 750 °C, and then kept at this temperature for 7 days so that the entire reaction is full. Finally, the growth process finished and cooled to room temperature.

Characterization
EDS element mappings and TEM images of the NbS3 flake were obtained by JEOL JEM‐2100F transmission electron microscopy. The height profiles of the NbS3 flakes were acquired by the commercial AFM equipment (Oxford, MFP‐3D). The crystal structure was characterized by an X‐ray diffractometer (Bruker D8). The binding energy of the element is obtained through XPS (Thermo Fisher Scientific K‐Alpha). The polarization characteristics of the phonon vibration were obtained by polarization Raman experiment at room temperature using a 100× objective lens (Jobin‐Yvon LabRAM HR Evolution spectrometer, 532 nm). Infrared photoabsorption is obtained by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (VERTEX70V).

Photodetector Fabrication and Measurement
The NbS3 FET devices were fabricated on SiO2/Si substrate with an oxide layer thickness of 300 nm. 2D NbS3 flakes were transferred to the substrates by mechanical peeling method. After electron beam lithography, thermal evaporation, and the lift‐off process, the source–drain electrodes (Cr/Au, 15 nm/55 nm) were fabricated. The NbS3 Schottky photodetectors were fabricated on SiO2/Si substrates with an oxide layer thickness of 300 nm. The source electrodes (Au, 30 nm) were patterned on top of the nanoplates by electron beam lithography system, thermal evaporation, and the lift‐off process. Then, 2D NbS3 flakes were transferred to Au electrodes. After electron beam lithography, thermal evaporation, and the lift‐off process, the electrodes were fabricated. The electrical properties of the photodetector were measured by using a Keithley B1500 semiconductor characterization system linked with a probe station. The photoelectric properties of the photodetector were measured with a Keithley 2636 semiconductor characterization system. Noise spectra at various bias conditions were acquired by a Model SR570 low‐noise current preamplifier and a 3567A dynamic signal analyzer (Keysight).

Electronic Structure and Property Calculations
The calculation methods were performed with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)[69] using the projector augmented wave (PAW)[70] method. Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof[71] functional was chosen to address the exchange‐correlation energy and the optB86b‐vdW[72] scheme was considered to account for weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions of layered triclinic NbS3 during structure relaxation. The plane‐wave cutoff energy, the criteria of energy convergence and forces on atoms were set to 400 eV, 10−5 eV and 0.02 eV Å−1, respectively. 5 × 4 × 3 and 5 × 4 × 1 of gamma centered k‐meshes were used to sample the first Brillouin zone of bulk phase and few‐layer structure of NbS3, respectively. For few‐layer structures, a vacuum layer thickness of 20 Å in the vertical direction was added to avoid interactions between neighboring images. The computational procedure of effective masses of carriers can be divided into two steps, with the help of the VASPKIT toolkit. Due to the reason that VASPKIT can generate the KPOINTS file including ultrafine k‐points around VBM (valence band maximum) or CBM (conduction band minimum) and then automatically get the result of effective masses. Therefore, in the first step, the VPKIT.in file should be prepared to denote numbers of points near VBM or CBM and k‐point spacing to fit the band, as well as the direction of k‐path of interest. In addition, the first line of VPKIT.in file is set to 1 for pro‐processing and run VASPKIT to get KPOINTS file for static calculation. In the second step, the first line of VPKIT.in file is modified to 2 for post‐processing and re‐run VASPKIT to get effective masses of carriers.
