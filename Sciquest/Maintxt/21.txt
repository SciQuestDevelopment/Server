Abstract: Organic semiconductors are photonic and electronic materials with high luminescence, quantum efficiency, color tunability, and size‐dependent optoelectronic properties. The self‐assembly of organic molecules enables the establishment of a fabrication technique for organic micro‐ and nano‐architectures with well‐defined shapes, tunable sizes, and defect‐free structures. DNAs, a class of biomacromolecules, have recently been used as an engineering material capable of intricate nanoscale structuring while simultaneously storing biological genetic information. Here, the up‐to‐date research on hybrid materials made from organic semiconductors and DNAs is presented. The trends in photonic and electronic phenomena discovered in DNA‐functionalized and DNA‐driven organic semiconductor hybrids, comprising small molecules and polymers, are observed. Various hybrid forms of solutions, arrayed chips, nanowires, and crystalline particles are discussed, focusing on the role of DNA in the hybrids. Furthermore, the recent technical advances achieved in the integration of DNAs in light‐emitting devices, transistors, waveguides, sensors, and biological assays are presented. DNAs not only serve as a recognizing element in organic‐semiconductor‐based sensors, but also as an active charge‐control material in high‐performance optoelectronic devices.

Introduction: The discovery of new optical and electrical phenomena in organic materials with π‐conjugated structures, commonly known as organic semiconductors, has led to the establishment of a new field of knowledge and its development for industrial applications.[1-3] The rapid increase in the number of studies on organic semiconductors and their properties facilitated the emergence of novel optoelectronic technologies through the application of chemical and material science.[4-6] Owing to their advantages, such as facile molecular tailoring for property optimization, highly flexible adaptation, and low‐cost fabrication, organic semiconductors based on polymers and small molecules containing π moieties are considered as great candidates for the essential elements of next‐generation miniature consumer devices.[7-9]

π‐conjugated organic semiconductors have been successfully realized as a platform for various optoelectronic materials, owing to their unique light absorption, emission, and charge transfer characteristics.[10-12] Many studies have been devoted to improving the electrical and optical properties of organic semiconductors. Well‐ordered assemblies based on π‐conjugated polymers (CPs) and small molecules can resolve the limitations of carrier transport ability and performance stability that are common in amorphous organic materials.[13] Moreover, better‐ordered organic assemblies have proved to enhance optoelectronic performance owing to their high crystallinity, thereby minimizing the grain boundaries and decreasing the defect density.[14, 15] There have been reviews on the assembly of organic semiconducting materials that expound on the basic principles of molecular design and self‐assembly engineering, leading to the fabrication of functional nano/microstructures derived from various types of molecules. Furthermore, relevant applications on electrical, optical, and photoelectrical devices have also been demonstrated.[16-18]

Notably, hybrid assembly has become an important aspect in the field of self‐assembly.[19, 20] Two or more types of organic semiconducting components are assembled into an ensemble through intermolecular interactions, such as van der Waals force, π‐π stacking, and hydrogen bonding.[21, 22] Hybrid assemblies can be classified into the following types: uniform‐doped structures,[23-25] gradient‐doped structures,[21] and hetero structures.[26-29] Most of these hybrid assemblies are utilized broadly as photonic elements, such as in light‐emitting color barcodes, white light sources, optical wavelength converters, multiple optical channels, photoelectrical transducers, and chemical transducers.[19] Although these applications cover many aspects, only a few of them employ hybrid assemblies possessing biological functions.

DNAs are generally regarded as carriers of genetic information. Nevertheless, pioneering studies, such as the study on DNA nano‐architectures conducted by Seeman et al., have broadened our understanding of DNA molecules.[30, 31] The outstanding work of Sleiman and co‐workers promoted the development of DNA molecular architectures, and it led to the further derivation of DNA‐based nanomaterials.[32-35] Given their unique physical and chemical properties, DNA‐associated architectures are considered as a new class of materials, and such hybrid materials containing DNAs have become the focus of many studies. The hybrids of π‐conjugated organic semiconductors with DNAs are mainly grown via self‐assembly, and it has drawn interest of researchers, particularly in its possible application to bio‐photonics, which can be employed in organic‐based sensing and optoelectronic devices. DNAs can serve as an efficient receptor element that recognizes biological/chemical targets or as an active layer material that assists in hole transport and electron blocking, both of which can result in the considerable enhancement in the luminescence efficiency in systems to which they are used in. For the utilization of DNAs in materials engineering, we recommend that the following properties be considered:
1)the wide bandgap of 4.7 eV,  with levels of LUMO at 0.9 eV  and HOMO at 5.6 eV,  which is important for charge transfer,
2)the dielectric constants ranging from 8.0 to 5.5 at frequencies from 1 to 1000 kHz,  which are useful for insulation,
3)the thermal stability maintained up to 230 °C,  when a double‐helix structure is formed, and
4)the diversity in molecular recognition through the combination of the four types of bases, namely, adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C), attached to anionic phosphate macromolecular chains.
In this report, we describe the hybrid assembly of DNAs with organic semiconductors. The primary purpose of this review is to provide an overall picture of the recent progress in research by organizing the basic knowledge and up‐to‐date research trends in this field. We first suggest interpretations of mechanisms of optical phenomena involved in polymeric organic semiconductors functionalized with DNAs in various forms, such as solution‐phase systems, arrayed polymers on solid substrates, and polymer nanowires where DNAs mainly act as a recognizing unit. In the subsequent section, we describe DNAs as drivers for the self‐assembly of small‐molecule organic semiconductors, demonstrating its role in the construction of crystalline organic particles. In the presence of DNAs, even conventional organic molecules used in organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) can become bioactive and generate biospecific photonics. Figure 1 illustrates the fabrication of hybrid assemblies of DNAs complexed with various organic semiconductors, demonstrating that their device application is a result of their endowed biofunctions. In the final section, we briefly introduce the role of DNAs in the improvement of electroluminescent devices, field‐effect transistors, sensors, and optical waveguides.

Main: 2 DNA‐Functionalized Polymeric Organic Semiconductors
2.1 Solution‐Phase Polymers
Over the past decades, the use of π‐CPs have gained popularity, owing to their compatibility with biological materials. They have also been considered as suitable platforms for the sensitive recognition of biomolecules (DNAs and proteins) due to their optical and electrical signal generation properties.[36] A considerable number of studies has been conducted on biosensing using CP–DNA hybrids in the aqueous phase.[37, 38] This is commonly carried out by changing the optical properties of the CP either by enhancing its luminescence depending on the degree of main chain alignment or decreasing its luminescence through energy transfer. In these applications, polymer–DNA hybrids are formed by electrostatic interaction, and specific substituents are attached to the polymer. The hybrids are sensitive to small amounts of specific stimuli because of the amplification of collective reactions such as in Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) or due to their fluorescence efficiency, as depicted in Figure 2a. For example, Bazan and co‐workers reported outstanding DNA detection using enhanced FRET from polymers to a signal quencher dye. The study employed two subjects, namely, a soluble CP and a probe DNA (pDNA) attached to a fluorescent dye. Upon excitation of the CP, the release of the optical properties of the fluorescent dye indicated the presence of the target DNA (tDNA), as illustrated in Figure 2b.[39] Wang and co‐workers presented a hybrid consisting of cationic polyfluorene and anionic Y‐shaped DNA (Y‐DNA), which provided a pathway for the simultaneous detection of multiplex nucleases. This method was based on different types of logic gate which operated by observing the emission wavelengths of different dyes with multiplex nucleases as inputs, as depicted in Figure 2c. In addition, the cleavage of Y‐DNA by nucleases was observed by electrophoresis analysis with a polyacrylamide gel. The pure Y‐DNA moved as a single band, while it appeared a faster‐moving band upon treatment with multiple nucleases, as HaeIII, PvuII, and EcoRV. as depicted in Figure 2d.[40]

Similarly, Whitten and co‐workers developed a mixture consisting of CPs and capture DNA.[41, 42] The mixture are then applied to tDNAs at variable amounts. After hybridization, a certain amount of DNA‐quencher is added, thus quenching the CP. The strength of the quenching is dependent on the amount of tDNAs that is bound to the mixtures.

In an effort to use no additional fluorescent dye, Leclerc and co‐workers described optical DNA sensors based on cationic polythiophene (PT)–DNA that transduced hybridization events into optical signals, which do not require the labeling of probes or targets. This method is based on different electrostatic interactions and conformational structures between PT and pDNAs or hybridized tDNAs, as depicted in Figure 2e. The pure PT in solution is yellow, which correspond to a random‐coil conformation. When a single‐stranded DNA (ssDNA) attaches to PT, the color of the solution changes to red; and upon the capture of complementary tDNAs, the triplex formation results in the color changing back to yellow. In this study, significant differences both in absorption spectra and colors are displayed by the two 1‐mer mismatch tDNAs, in comparison with the complementary sequence. A schematic description of the duplex and triplex formation is illustrated in Figure 2f.[43]

Recently, in addition to the detection of DNA molecules, hybrid solution systems can be utilized in the detection of thrombin proteins.[44] The employed strategy is the FRET‐switching competitively derived between the cationic CP and the Ir (III) complex. The two materials are assembled through π–π stacking interaction and electrostatic interaction, leading to the occurrence of FRET. The introduction of the thrombin‐specific aptamer–DNA blocked the FRET process; subsequently, FRET phenomenon reappeared as a specific binding proceeded between the aptamer–DNA and the thrombin protein, as shown in Figure 2g. As opposed to the abovementioned fluorescence‐based target detection, there is also an interesting report on the continuous readout of the activity of an endonuclease enzyme using an achiral cationic CP–DNA hybrid.[45] Here, the enzymatic activity is observed through the circular dichroism (CD) signals of the hybrid, as shown in Figure 2h.

Apart from the studies described above, there are reviews available on the utilization of biocompatible polymer–DNA complex assemblies to theragnostic gene delivery vehicles.[46, 47]

2.2 Arrayed Polymers
Majority of the studies on biosensing using π‐CP hybrids with DNA described above were conducted in the aqueous phase. Nevertheless, there are studies on π‐CP–DNA hybrids conducted in the solid state as well. One of the proposed techniques is the fabrication of arrayed chips. An initial discovery has been developed by Inganäs and co‐workers using a hybrid of zwitterionic PT derivative and single or double‐strand DNAs (dsDNAs). This method allows the fluorescent detection of DNA hybridization both in solution and on a chip, as shown in Figure 3a.[48] A novel protein chip is developed using PT derivative‐DNA aptamer hybrids.[49] Stoichiometric hybrids are prepared by mixing the cationic PT with a Cy3‐3′‐labeled single‐strand aptamer. An amine group is functionalized at the 5′‐end of the aptamer to enable the covalent binding of these hybrids onto surface‐treated glass slides. For the detection of human thrombin, a thrombin‐specific sequence is adopted for the aptamer. Upon spotting, these hybrids are immobilized on the glass slides (Figure 3b). The glass slides are scanned using an excitation wavelength of 408 nm,  which matches the main absorption of the PT derivative. In the presence of thrombin, the spots made of PT‐aptamer hybrids show a significant increase in fluorescence. Two other proteins, bovine serum albumin and IgE, used under the same conditions yield steady intensities of their fluorescent signals. This detection method is based on the FRET between fluorescent PT and many Cy3 moieties attached to neighboring aptamers, and on the fluorescence chain reaction. Kim and co‐workers reported a DNA chip made of conjugated poly(oxadiazole‐co‐phenylene‐co‐fluorene)–DNA hybrids, as depicted in Figure 3c.[50] DNA hybridization tests based on FRET from the emissive polymer to the dye‐labeled tDNA demonstrate a good selectivity and a significant signal amplification.

No fluorescent signal is observed in frames 1 and 2 because of the absence of pDNA. Intense fluorescent signals are clearly observed in frames 4, 5, 8, as the targets are matched with the pDNA. Slight non‐specific signals are observed in frames 3, 6, 7, with lower fluorescent intensities. d,e) Reproduced with permission.[51] Copyright 2012, Elsevier. f) Schematic illustration of CP‐based hybrids for detection and discrimination between virus and pathogens.

In addition to these FRET‐based detection methods using fluorescent dyes, Ahn and co‐workers developed an effective label‐free DNA chip made of polydiacetylene (PDA)–DNA hybrids for the multiplex detection of RNAs corresponding to various pathogenic microorganisms.[51] PDA is a valuable turn‐on CP which serves as a signal reporter owing to its unique optical properties, such as being capable of color change from blue‐ to‐ red and self‐emission triggered by an external stimulus.[52] After modification with pDNAs, the PDA vesicles are successfully arrayed to construct a biochip that can monitor the hybridization with complementary RNAs, as depicted in Figure 3d. Figure 3e illustrates the chip design for multiplex detection. Immobilized PDA vesicles in each frame are modified with pDNAs against various RNAs indicative of target bacteria. The label‐free detection of multiple bacteria is carried out using the arrayed chips based on PDA‐DNA hybrids, as seen in the fluorescence imaging.

Very recently, Wang and co‐workers developed a CP‐based strategy for the discrimination of virus and microbes.[53] Different analytes and the cationic PT derivative‐based hybrids are mixed in a well plate. Based on the fact that PT derivatives and their hybrids have different behaviors toward virus and microbes, the discrimination is performed by observing the change in the fluorescence intensity of the polymers, assisting the standard linear discriminant analysis, as shown in Figure 3f.

2.3 Polymer Nanowires
With the development of optical spectroscopy instruments, the physical and chemical properties of an individual nanoarchitecture can be thoroughly observed.[5] Hence, bio‐recognition based on CP–DNA hybrids can be conducted at the single nanoarchitecture level. For example, tDNA can be efficiently detected using a single strand of light‐emitting poly(3‐methylthiophene) (P3MT) nanowire.[54] The nanowires are electrochemically prepared using dopants based on a nanoporous template. The 5′‐end of pDNA is functionalized with an amine group, and the modified pDNA is then attached to the P3MT nanowires through electrostatic interactions between the sulfuric trioxide group of the dopant and the amine group of pDNA. The initial P3MT nanowire emits a green photoluminescence (PL), as illustrated in Figure 4a. After attaching the pDNAs, a color change from green to red is observed. The redshift of the PL is attributed to the conformational modification of the nanowire main chains by the electrostatic interactions. The PL signal of the P3MT–pDNA single nanowire is increased significantly upon treatment with complementary tDNAs. Figure 4b depicts the laser confocal microscopy (LCM) PL spectra of the single nanowires. The main PL peak of the initial P3MT single nanowire is observed at ≈554 nm.  As the nanowire is coupled with pDNAs, its main PL peak is redshifted to ≈640 nm, and its intensity slightly decreases, as depicted in the inset of Figure 4b. Upon treatment with the complementary tDNAs, the intensity of the LCM PL peak considerably increases. The PL enhancement of the P3MT–pDNA hybrid single nanowire is proportional to the concentration of tDNAs, from 100 × 10−18 m to 100 × 10−9 m.

The pDNA‐attached P3MT hybrid single nanowire can be selectively responsive to the imperfect DNA hybridization events caused by the luminescent P3MT nanowire. Cases of the 1‐mer nucleotide mismatches in tDNAs are explored to reveal their correlations with the PL responses in the P3MT nanowire, with reference to the complementary DNA–DNA hybridization, as depicted in Figure 4c. Figure 4d shows that the 1‐mer nucleotide mismatch and its position in the tDNAs are well reflected by the PL intensity of the P3MT nanowires. The more distant the mismatch position is from the nanowire surface, the higher the PL. This indicates that the relative length of the DNA–DNA hybridization from the surface can be efficiently monitored using the PL intensity of the hybrid nanowire, which reaches its highest value when the complementary hybridization is the longest.[55]

In addition to the PL analyses, the resonance Raman scattering (RRS) of CPs can also be utilized for bio‐recognition. Thrombin protein is recognized through the change in the RRS of the thrombin aptamer attached to the P3MT single nanowire.[56] Figure 4e illustrates the normalized UV/vis absorption spectra obtained for the nanowires of the P3MT, P3MT–thrombin aptamer, and P3MT–thrombin aptamer treated with thrombin proteins. For the initial P3MT, a broad doping‐induced bipolaron peak is observed at ≈800 nm,  and the π‐π* transition peak is observed at 385 nm.  After attaching a thrombin aptamer, a remarkable decrease in the intensity of the bipolaron peak is observed. After incubation with the thrombin proteins, new π‐π* transition peaks are observed at 550 and 610 nm.  This indicates the formation of a relatively well‐ordered configuration upon the interaction of the P3MT–thrombin aptamer nanowires with the thrombin proteins. The LCM Raman spectra of each single strand sample were measured under the same conditions. For the thrombin protein treated P3MT–thrombin aptamer nanowire, the Raman signal increased by ≈55‐folds based on the integrated intensities. The enhancement is attributed to the new π‐π* transition peak at 610 nm,  which matches the excited Raman laser energy of 633 nm;  this is so‐called RRS effect. For an in‐depth analysis, LCM Raman mapping experiments were performed under identical experimental conditions to obtain a reasonable evaluation of the enhancement. In comparison with the Raman signals of the P3MT–thrombin aptamer nanowires, those of the protein‐treated P3MT–thrombin aptamer nanowires exhibit higher intensity, as depicted in Figure 4f.

3 DNA‐Driven Hybrid Assembly of Small‐Molecule Organic Semiconductors
3.1 DNA‐Driven Assembly for Organic Semiconductor Hybrids
Generally, the hybrid building blocks of organic small molecules and DNAs are obtained through syntheses. Various synthetic approaches for organic small molecule‐DNA hybrids involve cross‐coupling reactions,[57-59] or phosphoramidite chemistry,[60-62] in which the functionalized organic molecules are introduced into the DNA via the end‐functional group or one of its bases.

Recently, hybrid assemblies composed of small organic molecules and ssDNAs were prepared by Ahn and co‐workers using non‐covalent bonding.[63, 64] They selected a typical coordination‐type organic semiconducting molecule, tri(8‐hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3), which was first reported by Tang and van Slyke.[65] In previous studies, Alq3 assemblies were mainly prepared by annealing,[66] evaporating,[67] and surfactant‐assisted methods.[68, 69] For example, Li and co‐workers prepared the Alq3 assemblies in rod‐like (Figure 5a) or hexagonal platelet‐like shapes (Figure 5b) by using surfactants, such as cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), respectively.[69] In contrast, instead of using surfactants, emissive hybrid assemblies can be successfully prepared into a hexagonal prismatic shape with the assistance of ssDNA molecules (Figure 5c,d). X‐ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out to observe the crystalline structure of the ssDNA‐assisted hybrid assemblies (Figure 5e). The XRD patterns of the hybrid assemblies exhibit two major peaks at 6.48° and 7.69°, corresponding to the (001) and (010) lattice planes, respectively. Although the prepared CTAB‐assisted Alq3 assemblies exhibit similar hexagonal prismatic shapes, they produce different XRD patterns with peaks at 6.42°, 11.43°, and 17.72°, corresponding to the (001), (011), and (021) crystalline lattice planes, respectively. Such patterns are comparable to those of the ssDNA‐assisted hybrid assemblies. Interestingly, as the ssDNA functionalized with the Cy3 fluorescent dye shows a larger spectral overlap with Alq3, a significant FRET is observed from the Alq3 molecules to the Cy3. However, when the dye is replaced with Cy5, the spectral overlap with Alq3 decreases, and the FRET effect nearly disappears (Figure 5f).

Endo and co‐workers reported that a light‐driven artificial nanomachine can be constructed based on a DNA–small molecule hybrid.[70] A pyrene‐modified walking DNA strand and another DNA strand connected by a disulfide bond are employed as anchorage sites to support the walker movement. As the pyrene molecules are excited by a 350 nm  light, the cleavage of the disulfide bond‐connected DNA strands is induced, enabling the DNA walker to migrate from one cleaved strand to the next one on the DNA tile, as shown in Figure 5g.

Interestingly, small organic semiconducting molecules, such as cyanuric acid, possessing three thymine‐like faces, have been reported to be capable of re‐programming the assembly of poly (adenine) into stable and long fibers with a unique internal structure, as shown in Figure 5h.[71]

3.2 DNA‐Hybrid Assemblies of OLED Small‐Molecule Enabling Recognition
A unique bio‐recognition function was discovered in hybrid assemblies containing OLED green‐emitting molecules.[72] Specific oligomeric DNA–DNA recognition has been successfully achieved using Alq3 rods crystallized with assistance from ssDNA molecules. Figure 6a illustrates a schematic representation of the recognition of specific tDNAs by the light‐emitting hybrid assembly. Color charge‐coupled device (CCD) images (Figure 6b) represent the hybrid assemblies before and after treatment with complementary tDNAs. The luminescence intensity of the hybrid assemblies increased after treatment with tDNAs. The morphological features of the hybrid assemblies were observed using high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR‐TEM, Figure 6c). The initial hybrid assembly exhibited a regular hexagonal prismatic shape with a smooth surface. Upon treatment with the complementary tDNA, the smooth surface became rough with the formation of a 120‐nm thick crust layer surrounding the inner core. To visualize the position of the DNA molecules, the ssDNA and tDNA molecules labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescent dyes, respectively, were traced using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The distribution of the ssDNA molecules is unique and has the shape of an hourglass over the hybrid assembly (Figure 6d). The tracing of the Cy5 dyes reveals that the tDNA molecules are present solely on the outer periphery of the assembly, while the distribution of ssDNA molecules is nearly maintained. Based on the comparison of the PL intensity of the crust layer and the inner core of the hybrid assembly after treatment with tDNAs, it was considered that the specific DNA–DNA hybridization is a reason for the increase of PL solely in the crust layer. As depicted in Figure 6e, a broad PL peak is observed at ≈512 nm  when the samples were excited with a 365 nm  laser. The PL intensity of the hybrid assemblies was enhanced by 1.6 times upon hybridization with complementary tDNAs, but not in the case of the 1‐mer mismatch tDNAs. Upon treatment with complementary tDNAs, the hybrid assemblies exhibited XRD patterns almost identical to that of the initial assemblies, except for the two additional peaks observed at 10.59° and 13.31° (Figure 6f). These two peaks are attributed to the formation of the dsDNA, forming a helical structure. However, these two peaks are absent in the case of those treated with the 1‐mer mismatch tDNAs, indicating that no helical dsDNA is present. Figure 6g shows the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE‐SEM) images of the hybrid assemblies. Upon treatment with complementary tDNAs, the initially smooth surface became rough. However, such surface roughness was not observed in the case with the 1‐mer mismatch tDNAs. Figure 6h depicts the cross‐section of the hybrid assembly recognizing a specific tDNA in the crust layer. PL enhancement in this region can be attributed to the fact that the formation of a DNA–DNA duplex prevents the non‐radiative relaxation of Alq3 molecules. These results indicate that Alq3, an organic semiconductor, when assembled with DNA, can recognize biological materials.

According to the literature, a specific sequence of thymine‐rich ssDNAs can be coordinated with mercury ions accompanied by a G‐quadruplex or hairpin‐shaped DNA conformation.[73, 74] Hence, the abovementioned hybrid assemblies can be used as a probe of mercury ions.[75] Figure 7a illustrates the in situ PL images of the hybrid assemblies before and after interaction with the mercury ion solution. When excited with a 365 nm  UV light, the assemblies stored in deionized (DI) water emitted a green luminescent light. PL intensity slightly decreased before exposure to the mercury ion solution, owing to the sedimentation of the assemblies. After excitation with a UV light for 60 min,  and shaking to disperse the sedimentation, the PL intensity returned to the initial level. However, the intensity of the PL signal continuously decreased after exposure to the mercury ion solution. The PL signal does not return to the initial level even after shaking. This phenomenon is also supported by the PL kinetics and the corresponding fitted curves, as depicted in Figure 7b. The PL depression of the hybrid assemblies is induced by the enhanced non‐radiative relaxation due to the surface mercury ions in the hairpin conformation of the ssDNA (Figure 7c). The selectivity of these hybrid assemblies was evaluated using other metal ions, such as potassium, sodium, zinc, chromium, cadmium, and copper. The PL depression caused by the other metal ions was found to be insignificant in comparison to that by mercury ions at the same concentration.

3.3 DNA‐Templating in Assembly and Polymerization of Organic Semiconductors
One “bottom‐up” approach is the use of DNA as a template for the deposition of both inorganic and organic semiconducting materials. The high anionic charge of the DNA phosphodiester backbone ensures a high affinity for cationic species to form of 1D hybrids.[76] Nanowires, including inorganic semiconductors[77, 78] and CPs[79-81] have been prepared using this method. Generally, in the case of CPs, growing cationic polymer chains associate with the anionic phosphate backbone. For example, He and co‐workers immobilized DNA strands on silicon wafers as templates for assembling polyaniline (PANi).[79] In an acidic solution, protonated cationic aniline monomers associate with the phosphodiester backbone of DNA through electrostatic interactions. Then, the monomers are polymerized using horseradish peroxidase and H2O2. The formation of PANi is indicated by the increase in the size of the wires when observed using an atomic force microscope (AFM). Additionally, Horrocks and co‐workers were able to prepare thin nanowires or thick nanoropes of polypyrrole (PPy) by using DNA templates (Figure 8a).[82] The PPy–DNA nanowires or nanoropes use the classic approach of pyrrole oxidation in the presence of ferric chloride. The cationic PPy strongly attaches to the anionic DNA backbone, and the thickness of the nanowire or nanorope is proportional to the reaction time. The formation of thick nanoropes was also observed using an AFM, as depicted in Figure 8b.

Recently, a study by Lee and co‐workers achieved the dynamic helicity‐switching of pyridine‐based organic molecules assembled on a double‐helix DNA.[83] In their report, the embedded DNA at a pH of 7.4 induces the right‐handed helical conformation of the outer assembly, identical to that of a DNA. At a pH of 5.5, the DNA and the outer assembly undergo a simultaneous helicity inversion from a right‐handed B form to a left‐handed Z form, as shown in the AFM image in Figure 8c. This phenomenon can also be generated by molecular dynamic simulations. The average dimension of embedded DNA at neutral conditions is calculated to be 28.4±2 .6 Å for B DNA, while that of embedded DNA at low pH is calculated to be 23.4 ± 2.5 Å for Z DNA, as shown in Figure 8d. Furthermore, helicity switching of the organic assembly is also driven by the low pH in endosomes during translocation into a cell.

Weil and co‐workers synthesized polydopamine using a DNA‐origami tube as a catalytic interior space.[84] This interior space is functionalized with G‐quadruplex/hemin‐based DNAzymes that initiate dopamine polymerization, as shown in Figure 8e. Feng and co‐workers assembled cationic PT and protein plasmid DNA into the polyplex hybrid nanoparticles.[85] These hybrid nanoparticles carrying DNA can be successfully delivered into HeLa cells, benefiting from the photocontrolled generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), as depicted in Figure 8f.

In addition to DNA, other biological materials, such as proteins,[86, 87] biomembranes,[88] and even microorganisms[89] have also been utilized as templates for the construction of hybrid assemblies.

4 Organic Semiconductor–DNA Hybrid Assemblies for Device Applications
The specific properties of DNA, such as its band structure and dielectric constant, are utilized to improve the charge transfer and optical properties of the active layer of various optoelectronic devices. Its well‐known feature as a specific receptor based on the anionic property of the main chains, which can target a variety of biological and chemical objects, is also widely used.

There is a vivid incompatibility between DNAs and conventional organic semiconducting molecules widely used in electronics.[90] To resolve this limitation, an approach using DNAs mixed with cationic surfactants, such as cetyltrimethylammonium (CTMA), has been used.[91] These complex film mixtures can be casted using standard methods, such as spin‐coating, dip‐coating, drop‐casting, and direct blading, and the resulting films exhibit excellent transmission over a broad wavelength range.[92] Because of their large bandgap and large dielectric constant, DNA–CTMA films have been successfully used in OLED and organic field‐effect transistors (OFET).

Owing to its large bandgap, the DNA–CTMA complex has been utilized as an electron‐blocking layer (EBL). The DNAs can help transport of holes but prevent escape of electrons, efficiently generating more excitons in emitting layers. This is because the organic semiconductors used are to match the HOMO level at 5.6 eV  and to be lower than the LUMO level at 0.9 eV  of the DNA complex layer. The complex thin film inserted into a luminescent OLED was first reported by Hirata et al., revealing the fact that the DNA‐layer preferentially transports holes.[92] Steckl and co‐workers reported that a complex incorporated as an EBL into a fluorescent‐type OLED was 30 times brighter than its OLED counterparts (Figure 9a).[93] The increase in performance is attributed to the low electron affinity of DNA, which serves as the EBL to confine the charge to the emitting layer (Figure 9b).[94] Moreover, the DNA complex can interface with some coordination‐type organic semiconducting materials, such as Ru complexes[95] or Eu complexes.[96] While the use of DNA in OLEDs has already been widely investigated, the use of nucleobases (NBs) in this field is only beginning to emerge. NBs require no surfactant modification because they can form high‐quality thin films by thermal evaporation. Bases A and T result in high luminescence performance and exceed the performance of DNA when used as EBLs and hole transport layers.[97]

In early studies, ssDNA with a G base sequence has been deposited as a p‐channel for OFET.[98, 99] The dielectric constant of the DNAs ranging 8.0–5.5 at frequencies of 1–1000 kHz offers an opportunity as a component of the organic transistors. It has been demonstrated that thin films of DNA–CTMA can be utilized as a gate dielectric layer for OFET.[100] Similar to the case of OLED, NBs can readily form consistent thin films by thermal evaporation and act as dielectric layers.[101] Recently, DNA and NBs have been utilized as charge injection layers of pentacene‐based OFET, as depicted in Figure 9c. The layers facilitate charge transfer between the metal and organic layer as a result of the reduced contact resistance.[102-104]

As a method which can be extended to become a tool for biochip application, Inganäs and co‐workers assembled stretched DNA and decorated it with PT derivates on a solid substrate using soft lithographic printing.[105] The use hybrid nanowires of CP and DNA as transistors have been studied, and their I–V measurement in ambient conditions shows a clear Ohmic behavior. As depicted in Figure 9d, biological sensors using OFET devices were developed to monitor the binding of specific DNAs onto the surfaces of organic semiconductor–DNA hybrid structures in the gate substrate.[106] Bao and co‐workers reported that DNA could be detected in situ in the label‐free manner using microfluid systems employing the hybrid structure shown in Figure 9e.[107] Bio‐recognition essentially relies on the direct adsorption of DNA onto the surface of organic semiconductors. Negatively charged DNA molecules induce p‐doping in the semiconductor and a large positive shift in threshold voltage. The DNA adsorbed onto the active layer can change the charge carrier density and the doping level in the organic semiconductor film.[108]

In other fields of OFET, devices based on an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) are mainly fabricated using a conductive poly (3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS).[109] The OECT can achieve label‐free sensing of DNA with higher sensitivity compared to OFETs because the ions injected from the electrolyte penetrate the organic semiconductor and modulate the bulk conductivity. Recently, the OECT applications of DNA‐templated conducting polymer biocomposites were reported, as shown in Figure 9f.[110] The results show that the DNA‐templated conductive polymers can be considered as a good candidate for OECTs and biosensors. The DNA as a counter poly‐ion can facilitate specific biodetection in contrast to PSS. This approach has the potential to be a useful strategy for future bioelectronics.

1D organic crystals composed of highly ordered π‐conjugated molecules are as an outstanding candidate for optical waveguides, owing to their excellent photon transfer ability. Since the publication of the study of an organic‐film‐coated optical waveguide sensor for vapor detection in 1975,[111] many applications based on the waveguide effect of 1D organic materials have been done.[19, 112-114] However, there are only a few reports on the use of 1D organic waveguides in sensing biological materials. Hence, to extend the functionality of waveguide to the field of biosensing, it is necessary to properly interface probe biomolecules onto 1D natural hybrids while retaining their waveguide nature. The DNA‐hybrid assemblies mentioned in Section 3.2 possess various advantages for optical waveguides, particularly as excellent candidates for biosensing. The bio‐recognition function has also been demonstrated in the aqueous phase of organic semiconductor–DNA hybrid assemblies.[72] Notably, the significant potential application of the waveguide effect is remote biosensing, owing to the large aspect ratio of the 1D organic hybrids, as described in Figure 9g. It is possible to transmit optical signals along the longitudinal axis of the 1D organic hybrids through local stimulation. Hence, biosensing can be achieved, without the need to excite the whole body, by utilizing local excitation away from where the biomolecules interact. Recently, Joo and co‐workers reported remote Cy3‐sensing using waveguide crystals made of blue‐emitting organic molecules decorated with quantum dots (QDs).[115] In contrast to the remote sensing achieved by FRET from QDs to dye‐labeled target biomolecules, there is now the possibility of label‐free remote biosensing for 1D organic semiconductor–DNA hybrids.

The DNA‐driven self‐assembly of organic materials can be an important part in the fabrication of organic bioelectronics.[116, 117] Pioneering researches have recently developed the self‐assembly of multi‐dimensional DNA structures with complex shapes.[32, 118] The programmable assembly of brush‐type DNA‐modified polymers on multi‐dimensional DNA origami can be used as a template via the sequence‐specific recognition of DNA strands, as shown Figure 9h.[119]

Conclusions: We have presented comprehensive and up‐to‐date investigations based on the hybrids of organic semiconducting materials and DNA. We have discussed the illustrations of the action mechanisms of the optical and electronic phenomena involved in the DNA‐functionalized and DNA‐driven organic semiconductor hybrids based on polymers and small molecules. A variety of hybrid assemblies were reviewed with emphasis on the roles of DNA in the assemblies. DNAs can play an important role in optoelectronic devices, not only as the bio‐recognition element in the sensors, but also as the active charge‐control material. Representative exemplary cases of recent technical advances were summarized.

The vast number of organic semiconducting molecules, extensive tunability of DNA molecules, their facile preparation, and their significant potential in technical applications make hybrid assemblies an amazing research field providing promising new opportunities. However, the underpinning premise of this prospect is that reasonable explanations on the nature of such hybrid assemblies have to be established. For instance, it is important to have an in‐depth exploration of: 1) the driving forces of the assembly and the role of DNAs during the process; 2) the unique distributions of the DNA molecules over the assembly that are currently quite difficult to control; and 3) the effects of the diversity of the length and sequence of the DNAs on the resulting optical and electrical properties of the hybrid assembly.

The application of DNAs in optoelectronic devices greatly increases the hole‐only transport and the luminous efficiency, thereby improving the performance of the devices that utilize organic semiconductor–DNA hybrid structures. The organic semiconductor molecules of commercial OLEDs can generate biophotonic signals by virtue of the DNAs. In order to facilitate the extensive utilization of the DNAs and DNA‐hybrids in device applications, the following technical matters are suggested to be carried out and established: 1) a novel methodology to control the bandgap of DNA‐hybrids, which is the most crucial breakthrough necessary to extend possible applications, 2) the stability assessment of device performance and thermal stress to ensure further practical developments, and 3) the compatibility of the fabrication processes involving DNA‐hybrids with extant device production technologies.

We believe that, as these matters are gradually resolved, the field of organic semiconductor–DNA hybrid assemblies will become significantly developed in the future. DNAs will be considered more as a highly valuable component eligible for future optoelectronic devices in the aspect that it can design numerous types of crystals through sequence control and can implement programmable and intricate nanoarchitectures.
