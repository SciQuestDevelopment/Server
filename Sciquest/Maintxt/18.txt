Abstract: In the past few decades, tremendous advances have been made in electrocatalysis due to the rational design of electrocatalysts at the nanoscale level. Further development requires engineering electrocatalysts at the atomic level, which is a grand challenge. Here, the recent advances in cation exchange strategy, which is a powerful tool for fine‐tuning atomic structure of electrocatalysts via surface faceting, heteroatom doping, defects formation, and strain modulation, are the main focus. Proper atomic structure engineering effectively adjusts the electronic structure, and thus enhances the electronic conductivity and facilitates the adsorption/desorption of reaction intermediates. By virtue, the cation exchange strategy greatly boosts the intrinsic and apparent activities of electrocatalysts and shows a great potential toward design of new energy conversion devices, such as water splitting devices and metal–air batteries. It is believed that cation exchange offers new insights and opportunities for the rational design of a new generation of electrocatalysts.

Introduction: Global concerns over energy security and climate change have driven the development of sustainable clean energy.[1] Recently, advanced technologies for clean energy production, such as fuel cells,[2-4] water electrolysis,[5] and metal–air batteries,[6-10] have received extensive attentions in academic and industrial research community. The wide application of these sustainable energy technologies is still hindered by the sluggish kinetics of some key electrocatalytic reactions, including oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)[11-14] for fuel cells and metal–air batteries, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)[15] and oxygen evolution reaction (OER)[12, 16] for water electrolysis. Circumventing these challenges requires the development of entirely new electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity, selectivity, and long‐term durability.

In the past decade, a substantial progress has been made in the design of advantageous nanostructured electrocatalysts to increase the total number of active sites and/or enhance the intrinsic activity of each active site.[17-20] Even so, there are still enormous opportunities for further improvement of the performance of current electrocatalysts. As the overall catalytic performance of an electrocatalyst is principally governed by its electronic structure,[21] the ultimate goal is to regulate its electronic structure atom‐by‐atom, which is still a grand challenge.

Cation exchange is a chemical conversion technique, replacing the cations in a parent ionic material with a different group of cations.[22-27] The past two decades have witnessed the revival of cation exchange as a powerful method to obtain high quality nanomaterials with surface faceting,[6, 28, 29] and/or heteroatom doping,[30-33] and/or introduction of defects,[28, 34-38] and/or strain engineering.[26, 39, 40] These atomic‐scale structure controls endow cation exchange with possibility to exquisitely modulate the electronic structure of transformed materials.

In this progress report, we focus on the recent developments of cation exchange technology in the preparation of advanced electrocatalysts. Our intention is to show how cation exchange can regulate the atomic and electronic structure of electrocatalysts for excellent performance. Finally, the major challenges and opportunities of cation exchange in the field of engineering electrocatalysts are presented.

Main: 2 Cation Exchange
The fabrication of highly active catalysts requires a thoughtful tuning of the nucleation and growth process to control their composition, size, and shape. However, this kinetic process remains poorly understood, and it is consequently difficult to simultaneously tune all the structural parameters of the obtained catalysts. Nevertheless, for some classes of nanomaterials, such as metal sulfides and oxides, synthetic protocols have been nicely developed. Their compositions, sizes and shapes can be precisely controlled. If designed cation exchange reactions occur, these nanomaterials can be used as templates for target nanocrystals. In this occasion, the target nanocrystals can maintain their template size and shape.

An overall cation exchange reaction can be elucidated by
M𝑛+ + CA ⇌ MA + 𝐶𝑛+
 (1)
where M is the replacing metal cation, and C and A represent the parent cation and anion, respectively (Figure 1). The overall cation exchange reaction can be divided into[23]
CA ⇌  C0 + A0  − (Δ𝐺𝑓0)CA
 (2)
A0 ⇌  A𝑛+ + 𝑛e−  − (𝐸0)A𝑛+
 (3)
M0 + A0 ⇌  MA  (Δ𝐺0𝑓)MA
 (4)
M𝑛+ + ne− ⇌   M0  (𝐸0)M𝑛+
 (5)
where ΔGf0 is the standard formation free energy and E0 is the standard reduction potential of the metal cation. The thermodynamic driving force for the overall cation exchange reaction is calculated by[23]
Δ𝐺reaction=(Δ𝐺0f)MA−(Δ𝐺0f)CA−𝑛𝐹[(𝐸0)M𝑛+−(𝐸0)A𝑛+]
 (6)
where F is Faraday's constant. The calculated driving force can predict the possibility of a cation exchange reaction.[22, 23]

In practice, the progress of a cation exchange reaction may significantly differ from thermodynamic considerations,[22, 23] because kinetic factors, such as activation barrier,[41] play an important role in determining the feasibility of this reaction. This is especially true for nanocrystals with high surface areas. At the nanoscale level, the low‐coordinated, defect‐rich, and strained surfaces usually serve as ideal high‐energy sites for ion exchange reactions.[22, 23] After the exchange reaction, these advantageous structure features can be retained. This makes cation exchange a particularly attractive synthetic tool to tailor the atomic/electronic structure of electrocatalysts.

3 Tuning Atomic Structure of Nano‐Electrocatalysts by Cation Exchange
3.1 Creating Surface Faceting
Engineering surface facets with favorable atomic arrangement and coordination is one of the most promising routes to optimize the performance of catalysts.[42-47] Cation exchange can be shape‐preserving, when the template nanocrystals are large enough to maintain the stability of anionic lattice. This provides an opportunity to tailor the surface facets of exchanged products. As one example, hexahedral Cu1.8S nanocrystals, enclosed by six {001} facets, were converted into hexahedral CdS nanocages,[29] whereas dodecahedral Cu1.75S nanocrystals, terminated by twelve {010} facets, were transformed into dodecahedral CdS nanocages (Figure 2a).

Besides, crystal reorganization usually occurs in nanoscale cation exchange to facilitate ion replacement.[22] In this case, active facets with high surface energy can serve as exchange‐dominant facets and are finally retained after cation exchange reaction. These high energetic facets, however, are seldom achieved by traditional synthetic methods under thermodynamic conditions, unless foreign anions,[45] gas molecules,[48] or surfactants[43] are introduced to stabilize the active facets. Nevertheless, these stabilizers can affect the activity or/and the stability of the catalysts. Therefore, creating “clean” active facets via kinetics controlled cation exchange is highly desirable for catalysis.

Recently, we achieved surface faceted CoO nanorods by cation exchange,[28, 49-51] using ZnO nanorods as sacrificial templates. After exchange reaction, the smooth {100} surface of ZnO was converted into textured surface of CoO. Our experimental and simulated high‐angle annular dark field‐scanning transmission electron microscopy (HADDF‐STEM) characterizations demonstrated that the textured surface of exchanged CoO nanorods consists of numerous nanopyramids (Figure 2b), which preferentially expose {111} facets (Figure 2c).[28] It should be noted that the surface energy of CoO {111} facet is much higher than that of other low‐indexed facets. Without stabilizer, {111} facets of CoO are difficult to obtain by thermodynamically controlled synthesis.[52] In our case, the high‐energetic {111} facets allow for easy ion substitution during the cation exchange process, thus they remain on the surface of the exchanged products.

These faceted oxide nanorods can further serve as supporting materials to load foreign catalytic materials. For instance, we deposited Pt nanoparticles on pre‐synthetic CoO nanorods by magnetron sputtering.[50] The negligible lattice mismatch between Pt and CoO assured the eptaxial growth of Pt on CoO with atomically perfect interface (Figure 2d), and the {111}‐faceted CoO nanorods endow the favorable {111} faceting of Pt,[50] which is particularly active toward ORR.

3.2 Regulating Heteroatom Doping
In addition to surface faceting, heteroatom doping can also significantly improve the performance of electrocatalysts.[53-56] Nevertheless, it is a great challange to grow high‐quality heteroatom‐doped nanocrystals. In traditional methods, heteroatoms are generally introduced into host materials by incorporating dopant precursor during growth. Unfortunately, heteroatoms are often dismissed to the surface of the host materials due to the “self‐purification” effect. This results in poor stoichiometric control of the dopants[33] (Figure 3a). In contrast, a controllable heteroatom doping can be easily realized by partial/incomplete cation exchange or by adding dopants into the replacing metal cations. The cation exchange strategy separates the growth of host materials from the heteroatom incorporation,[30-33] which permits a precisely controllable doping by regulating the stoichiometry or designing the cation substitution kinetics.

For instance, hetero‐metal doping of CdTe nanocrystals was realized by exposing CdTe nanocrystals to the solution containing desired metal ions.[57] The cation exchange Hg2+ with CdTe nanocrystals yielded HgxCd1−xTe nanocrystals with tunable Hg content from 0% to 60%.[57] Similar cation exchange was carried out by exposing CdSe nanocrystals in Ag+ solution with a specific molecule, trialkyl phosphine.[58] The strong adsorption of trialkyl phosphine on Ag+ significanlty reduced the driving force for cation exchange, allowing the inclusion of Ag+ dopants at concentrations as low as ≈1 Ag+ per nanocrystal.[58]

Besides well stoichiometric control, cation exchange reactions can achieve atomic‐scale uniform hetetoatom‐doping. Recently, we realized Ni,Zn dual‐doped CoO by incomplete gas‐phase cation exchange in a tube furnace at 500–600 °C.[49] The high temperature provides enough thermal energy for the dopants to diffuse from the surface into the interior of the host lattice, and meanwhile offers sufficient fluidity of the host lattice to allow the rapid outward diffusion of the internal cations (Figure 3b). This bi‐directional ion diffusion enables the final products to reach the thermodynamic solid‐solution composition, thus achieve atomic‐level uniform distribution of the dopants (Figure 3c).[49]

3.3 Introducing Defects
Defect engineering is another general strategy to enhance the intrinsic activity of electrocatalysts.[59-62] In cation exchange, defects play a crucial role, which control the communication between the parent and the product crystals, and provide sufficient mobility for the guest ions entering into the host crystal. Therefore, it is convenient to use cation exchange to incorporate defects into the nanocrystal host.

Recently, we fabricated a series of oxygen vacancies (O‐vacancies) rich oxides (pristine CoO, doped CoO, NiO, etc.) by cation exchange (Figure 4a,b).[28, 30, 39, 63] The distribution and concentration of O‐vacancies on the exchanged oxides were characterized by detailed X‐ray absorption spectroscopy and the electron energy‐loss spectroscopy (EELS). Specifically, using the shift of Co‐L2,3 edge spectrum of exchanged CoO as compared to that of reference CoO (Figure 4c), the concentration of O‐vacancies on the exchanged CoO surface was estimated to be ≈12.5%.[39] The EELS results revealed that the O‐vacancies were mainly enriched at 2–3 nm region from the outermost layer of the exchanged oxide.[30]

We wish to emphasize that the O‐vacancies generated by common hydrogen annealing method are usually distributed throughout the particle, and excessive O‐vacancy concentration will damage the treated particle. By contrast, O‐vacancies produced by exchange reaction were mainly frozen on the surface of the exchange product, which significantly increased the local O‐vacancy concentration. Moreover, the O‐vacancy concentration can be fine‐tuned by simply changing the cation exchange temperature. As evidenced by our works,[28, 39, 49, 63] the surface enriched O‐vacancies are superactive sites for oxygen‐involved catalystis, such as HER, ORR, and OER.

3.4 Exerting Strain
Since nanocrystals can sustain very high lattice strain compared with their bulk counterpart, strain engineering (expanding or compressing arrangements of atoms) emerges as a new degree of freedom to effectively manipulate the electronic structure of the catalysts at atomic level.[26, 39, 40, 64-68] For example, the most active Pt‐based alloy electrocatalysts were fabricated by compressing surface Pt atomic layer through embedding transition metal atoms in the underlying atomic layers to tune the Pt d‐band structure, thus enhance the ORR catalytic activity of Pt.[53, 66, 69-72]

Cation exchange has shown its great potential in engineering strain in nanocrystals through “heterogeneous” or “homogeneous” exchange.[22] A “heterogeneous” exchange allows a partial cation substitution to introduce sharp interfaces or heterojunctions within a nanocrystal (Figure 5a). For instance, the partial exchange of CdS with Ag+ leaded to the formation of CdS‐Ag2S heterojunctions.[26] At the CdS‐Ag2S interface, CdS experienced a 4% expansion of the Ag2S lattice along the interface plane and a 15% contraction perpendicular to the interface plane (Figure 5b). Due to the elastic repulsion between neighboring segments of Ag2S resulting from the lattice‐mismatched‐caused strain field, the Ag2S–CdS regions are spontaneously arranged into superlattice structure. For this “heterogeneous” exchange, the maximum amounts of strain were located at the interface, and gradually relaxed away from the interface.

Rencently, we engineered the lattice strain on the faceted surface of CoO through “homogeneous'’ cation exchange[39] (Figure 5c). The atomic‐level distribution of the lattice strain was clearly revealed by HADDF‐STEM and geometric‐phase analysis. Figure 5d presents the lattice strain component ε11 (in the {111} plane) and ε22 (perpendicular to the {111} plane) associated with the expansion/contraction of the respective lattice vectors R1 and R2, and the sheer strain component ε12. The values of ε11, ε12, and ε22 were approximately zero in the inner nanorod, and gradually increased to a large positive value in the outermost layer of the nanorod, indicating the existence of biaxial tensile strain on the surface. The theoretical calculations demonstrated that the tensile strain was originated from abundant O‐vacancies located on the surface of the nanorod, which expanded the lattice of the exchanged nanorod. Notably, this “homogeneous” exchange‐induced strain was mainly distributed on the topmost surface of the exchanged product, which was different from that arose from “heterogeneous” exchange.

Strain engineering is also used to regulate the properties of two‐dimensional materials by cation exchange.[73-75] Recently, the surface chemistry of MXenes was effectively modulated by expanding their interlayer spacing through exchanging intercalated Li+ with various cations.[73] This interlayer spacing adjustment has been found to affect the performance of MXenes in many applications, such as electrochemical energy storage, water purification, etc.

4 Modulating Electronic Structure of Nano‐Electrocatalysts via Tuning Atomic Structure by Cation Exchange
The performance of a catalyst is fundamentally governed by its electronic structure, and an appropriate electronic structure engineering assures the best catalytic activity.[21] The cation exchange strategy can adjust the atomic structure of the catalyst by surface faceting, heteroatomic doping, introducing defects and strain engineering, etc., so as to achieve accurate control of the electronic structure of the catalyst.

4.1 Promoting Electronic Conductivity
If a catalytic material is not sufficiently conductive, electron transport to the surface active sites is blocked,[76] thus impeding the progress of the electrocatalytic reaction (Figure 6a). For this reason, we enhanced the electronic conductivity of oxide nanorods through introducing large amounts of O‐vacancies by cation exchange.[28, 30, 39, 63] The density functional theory calculations revealed that by creating O‐vacancy in CoO, some new electronic states appeared in the bandgap (Figure 6b).[28] As a result, the electrical conductivity of the O‐vacancy rich CoO nanorods was significantly enhanced, which remarkably improved their ORR and OER performance.[28]

Recently, we attempted to further enhance the electronic conductivity of oxide electrocatalysts through heteroatom doping by cation exchange.[6, 30] The calculated density of states showed that Zn doping in CoO introduced some new electronic states in the bandgap (Figure 6c).[30] These enhanced electronic states endowed Zn‐doped CoO with nearly 10‐fold enhancement in charge carriers as compared with the pristine one.[30] Benefiting from the improved electronic conduction, the catalytic capability of the doped oxide was greatly boosted.[49]

These examples illustrate that for non‐metal catalysts, the intrinsic electronic conductivity is a crucial factor that governs their performance; however, this aspect has been previously ignored. The combination of heteroatom doping, defects engineering, etc., by a properly designed cation exchange process may provide a thorough solution to the inferior conductivity of non‐metal electrocatalysts.

4.2 Optimizing Energetics of Reaction Intermediates
According to the Sabatier principle,[77] the ideal catalyst should bind the reaction intermediates neither too weakly nor too strongly. Therefore, it is of significant importance to optimize the energetics of reaction intermediates on electrocatalysts to enhance their electrocatalytic activity. As discussed before, cation exchange can be effectively used to modulate the surface atomic structure of the electrocatalysts, and thus optimize the adsorption–desorption energetics of intermediates. For example, we demonstrated that the facilitated formation of HOO* (the rate‐determining step for ORR) on oxide catalysts by generating O‐vacancies[28] (Figure 7a). Recently, we fine‐tuned the hydrogen adsorption energy on CoO through strain engineering[39] (Figure 7b), which boosted the intrinsic activity of CoO close to the top of the volcano plot for HER catalysts.

Moreover, we tuned the energetics of ORR intermediates on a cation exchanged new oxide, Co2VO4, through modulating its spin states.[78] Co2VO4 is a spinel oxide, with half of Co2+ ions occupying oxygen‐octahedra. Our calculation results revealed that the contraction of CoO octahedra in Co2VO4 enhanced the crystal field and increased the energy gap between t2g and eg, leading to the spin transition of Co2+ from the high spin state to the low spin state (Figure 7c). Compared with high spin Co2+, intermediates adsorbed more strongly on low spin Co2+ and the potential limiting step was changed into the desorption of *OH with a much smaller barrier of 0.59 eV (Figure 7d).

Recently, we achieved Ni doping, O‐vacancy creation, and strain engineering simultaneously on CoO nanorods by cation exchange.[49] The cutting‐edge characterization combined theoretical calculations verified that Ni dopant clustered around surface O‐vacancies of CoO to form the slightly strained Nix‐Ov clusters.[49] In these Nix‐Ov clusters, Ni dopant and tensile strain enlarged the Bader charge of O atom, lifting the O 2p orbital position closer to the anti‐bonding orbital. This afforded a desired electronic structure for the adsorption/desorption of hydrogen intermediate (Figure 7e).

It is noteworthy that although surface faceting, heteroatom doping, defects and strain engineering, spin regulating, etc., have been used separately to adjust the adsorption/desorption of reaction intermediates, the combination of these strategies undoubtedly adds flexibility for effective tuning the energetics of reaction intermediates. Fortunately, this goal can be achieved by a proper‐designed cation exchange process, as demonstrated by our previous work.[49]

5 Applications of Cation Exchanged Electrocatalysts
As discussed above, cation exchange provides a controllable way to optimize the atomic and electronic structure of nanostructured electrocatalysts. By virtue, the intrinsic and apparent activity of electrocatalysts are greatly enhanced. The further practical application of these optimized electrocatalysts in energy conversion devices requires mass production and control of the atomic/electronic structure as well.

Recently, we have tried to fabricate Ni,Zn dual‐doped CoO nanorods on a large scale directly on carbon fiber paper substrates for water splitting devices. As templates for cation exchange, uniform ZnO nanorods were grown on 2 cm × 10 cm carbon fiber paper substrate using the repeatable hydrothermal method. The cation exchange was performed within a tube furnace in gas phase. The overall synthetic procedure was compatible with sizable substrate. Besides, the featured atomic structure, including surface faceting and atomic‐level uniform doping, was successfully retained in the large‐scale production (Figure 8a). As anticipated, the Ni,Zn dual‐doped CoO nanorods achieved superior HER activity, and outperformed the reported active metal oxide,[39] metal oxide/metal,[79-81] metal sulfide,[82] and metal phosphide[83] catalysts. The electrolyzer device assembled by Ni,Zn dual‐doped CoO nanorod electrodes exhibited only 280 mV overpotential to drive the hydrogen generation current density of 10 mA cm−2, which was 140 mV smaller than that for the Pt‐ and RuO2‐based device (Figure 8b). Further, a massive production of Ni‐doped CoO nanosheets was accessed by cation exchange for high energy density zinc‐air battery (Figure 9).[6] These nanosheets assembled all‐solid‐state coin cells successfully powered 17 light‐emitting diodes and charged an iPhone.

The presented examples illustrate that the cation exchange permits a fully controllable synthesis of catalysts from macro‐ through micro‐, nano‐ to atomic level. It is expected that in near future, a wide variety of electrocatalysts will be available for various electrocatalytic reactions beyond ORR, HER, and OER, such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide reduction reactions, as well as large‐scale energy conversion devices.

Conclusion and prospects: With the fast development of cation exchange synthesis strategy, the past two decades have witnessed its revival as a versatile tool to fabricate high quality nanomaterials with well‐controlled size and morphology for widespread application in optoelectronic, photocatalytic, and bioimaging. This review highlights recent advances in using this powerful technique to fabricate high performance electrocatalysts. It demonstrates how cation exchange can be used to rationally engineer the atomic and electronic properties of electrocatalysts for renewable energy relevant reactions. Despite these exciting accomplishments, a huge space remains to advance this strategy in electrocatalysis. The future research directions include but are not limited to:
The surface atomic and electronic structure of the cation exchanged electrocatalysts during electrochemical reactions is not well‐studied. Therefore, it is necessary to use in situ and operando techniques combined with theoretical modelling to investigate the structural changes in electrocatalysts during the reactions.[84] This would provide the basic understanding of the working catalysts and is of significant importance for the rational design and modulation of the performance of new catalysts.

With the current availability of the well‐controlled metal oxide and sulfide catalysts, the cation exchange strategy needs to be explored for a variety of active materials, such as metal phosphides, selenides, nitrides, etc. Recently, the cation exchange strategy has been extended to synthesize single metal catalysts.[85-88] A combination of the cation exchanged single metal atoms with the well‐controlled oxide or sulfide materials may create new and exciting opportunities for achieving unique catalytic performance.

Long‐term stability evaluation must be explored in details for possible applications.[89, 90] The assessment should be made on a monthly basis and the changes in catalyst composition, the mass of the catalyst, and catalyst surface area should be carefully investigated. Moreover, the practical applications require economical, safe, and large‐scale cation exchange technology. This demands innovations in manufacturing devices to enable mass production while keeping strict control over size, facets, doping, defects, and strain of electrocatalysts.
