Abstract: Low‐cost and high‐safety aqueous Zn‐ion batteries are an exceptionally compelling technology for grid‐scale energy storage. However, their development has been plagued by the lack of stable cathode materials allowing fast Zn2+‐ion insertion and scalable synthesis. Here, a lattice‐water‐rich, inorganic‐open‐framework (IOF) phosphovanadate cathode, which is mass‐producible and delivers high capacity (228 mAh g−1) and energy density (193.8 Wh kg−1 or 513 Wh L−1), is reported. The abundant lattice waters functioning as a “charge shield” enable a low Zn2+‐migration energy barrier, (0.66 eV) even close to that of Li+ within LiFePO4. This fast intrinsic ion‐diffusion kinetics, together with nanostructure effect, allow the achievements of ultrafast charging (71% state of charge in 1.9 min) and an ultrahigh power density (7200 W kg−1 at 107 Wh kg−1). Equally important, the IOF exhibits a quasi‐zero‐strain feature (<1% lattice change upon (de)zincation), which ensures ultrahigh cycling durability (3000 cycles) and Coulombic efficiencies of 100%. The cell‐level energy and power densities reach ≈90 Wh kg−1 and ≈3320 W kg−1, far surpassing commercial lead–acid, Ni–Cd, and Ni–MH batteries. Lattice‐water‐rich IOFs may open up new opportunities for exploring stable and fast‐charging Zn‐ion batteries.

Main: The ever‐growing fossil fuel consumption and environmental pollution trigger persistent exploration of reliable large‐scale battery systems for storing and utilizing energy harnessed from intermittent renewable power sources.[1, 2] Lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) are by far the most sophisticated technology, however, the scarcity of lithium resources and safety concerns largely limit their applications in stationary energy storage.[1-3] As alternatives, rechargeable aqueous zinc‐ion batteries (ZIBs) have been recognized as an exceptionally promising solution because of high theoretical capacity (820 mAh gZn−1 or 5851 mAh cmZn−3), compatibility with aqueous electrolytes, low cost and low toxicity of Zn anodes as well as intrinsic safety from the aqueous nature.[4-11] Despite the multiple advantages, the divalent nature of Zn2+ has set up formidable obstacles to the implementation of ZIBs. Zn2+ ions have strong electrostatic interactions (ionic bonding) with host lattice, hence, their repeating (de)insertion typically initiates substantial lattice strain, structural degradation, and inferior cyclability to cathode hosts.[5-9] On the other hand, the strong electrostatic interactions cause sluggish solid‐state Zn2+ migration within cathodes and thus, voltage polarization and depressed energy efficiency.[5-9] Therefore, the key challenge facing ZIBs is exploring low‐cost cathodes that store as many Zn2+ as possible while exhibiting low lattice strain and fast kinetics.

MnO2, the cathode material in alkaline primary ZIBs, is first investigated and demonstrates reversible electrochemistry.[4] As the recent revivification of rechargeable ZIBs, diverse types of cathodes have been intensively investigated. Mn‐based materials[11-18] and Prussian blue analogs (PBAs)[19-21] provide high battery voltages (≈1.3–1.6 V); however, the former typically suffers from Mn2+‐dissolution and short cycle life primarily due to lattice strain generation (though adding Mn2+‐salts in electrolyte suppresses Mn2+ dissolution to some extent), while the latter delivers low capacities (60–120 mAh g−1). In contrast, vanadium oxides/vanadates frequently exhibit high capacities, good cyclability, and rate capability (in particular, for hydrated compounds in which lattice waters weaken electrostatic interactions between Zn2+ and cathode skeletons), but offer relatively low voltage (typically 0.6–0.8 V).[5, 6, 10, 22-34] Incorporating PO43− units raises vanadium redox potential to ≈1.1–1.3 V via inductive effect,[35-37] however, these phosphovanadates, such as LiV2(PO4)3[35] and Na3V2(PO4)3,[36] exhibit similarly low capacities as PBAs due to a large portion of inactive PO43−. Given these circumstances, vanadium‐based structures possessing balanced PO43− units, abundant lattice waters, and low‐strain feature are highly anticipated to achieve desired overall performance.

Herein, we for the first time report a lattice‐water‐rich inorganic open‐framework (IOF) cathode KV2O4PO4·3.2H2O, which simultaneously accumulates multiple preponderances. First, the IOF allows reversible intercalation of ≈1.5 Zn2+ per formula unit at an average plateau voltage (0.85 V) exceeding those of vanadium oxides and delivers high discharge capacity (228 mAh g−1) and energy density (193.8 Wh kg−1 or 513 Wh L−1). Secondly, the IOF exhibits a <1% lattice change during cycling, enabling a long lifespan of 3000 cycles and Coulombic efficiencies of 100%. Thirdly, the abundant lattice waters as “charge shield” elevate Zn2+‐migration kinetics, thereby enabling exceedingly fast charging (71% state of charge in 1.9 min) and ultrahigh power (7200 W kg−1 at 107 Wh kg−1). Last but not the least, the IOF is composed of low‐cost elements and its production process is simple yet scalable (prerequisites for large‐scale applications). The underlying reaction mechanism and Zn2+‐migration kinetics are also elucidated through experimental analyses and dynamics simulations.

KV2O4PO4·3.2H2O (KVP) is synthesized by a reflux method within 30 min (Figure 1a and Figure S1, Supporting Information). The obtained rod‐shaped microparticles (MPs) are subsequently wet‐milled into nanoparticles (NPs) with a diameter of ≈100 nm (Figure 1b–e). The reflux and wet milling process are simple and suitable for massive production, preferable to hydrothermal or solvothermal methods predominantly adopted for producing ZIB cathodes.[5, 7] The chemical formula is confirmed by combined inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP), X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Figure 1f, Figures S2 and S3, Supporting Information). KVP crystallizing in the orthorhombic system (P212121) exhibits an IOF structure comprised of VO6 and PO4 polyhedra, and K+ and lattice waters fill in the open channels (Figure 1g). The number of lattice waters reaches 1.6 per redox center, substantially higher than those of previous reports (typically <1.0) (Table S1, Supporting Information). This lattice‐water‐rich feature, in theory, facilitates the shielding of the notorious electrostatic interactions between intercalants and hosts. Upon ion exchange in 3 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 aqueous solution for 12 h, KVP turns to Zn0.22K0.56VP with little change of lattice parameters (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Because every two K+ are replaced by one half‐size Zn2+ (ionic radius: 0.138 vs. 0.074 nm), the aliovalent substitution creates large interstitial vacancies accommodating Zn2+ intercalation. Zn0.22K0.56VP exhibits a density (2.65 g cm−3) smaller than those of the typical closely‐stacked cathodes (>3 g cm−3) but larger than those of metal–organic framework PBAs (<2 g cm−3), favoring a balance between lattice strain and volumetric capacity.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge‐discharge analyses reveal the redox behavior of the IOF cathode (Figure 2). Two cathodic peaks at 0.93 and 0.59 V and two anodic ones at 1.04 and 0.72 V can be assigned to the reversible and stepwise intercalation and extraction of Zn2+, respectively. The anodic peak at 1.42 V appears only once and corresponds to irreversible K+ extraction during initial charging, which coincides with a lower initial discharge capacity (106.5 mAh g−1) compared to the charge one (128.9 mAh g−1) (Figure 2a,b, and Figure S5, Supoorting Information) and is further discussed later. After three activation cycles, the IOF delivers a discharge capacity of 228 mAh g−1 (or 604 mAh cm−3), which is 50–280% higher than those of ZnMn2O4,[14] PBAs,[19-21] and phosphovanadates,[35-37] and is comparable to those of Zn3V2O7(OH)2·2H2O (≈213 mAh g−1)[29] and Zn0.25V2O5·nH2O (≈282 mAh g−1).[10] The discharge plateau voltage reaches 0.85 V on average, overwhelmingly surpassing vanadium oxides and vanadates (Figure 2c).[5, 6, 10, 22-34] On the material level, the IOF provides an energy density of up to 193.8 Wh kg−1 (or 513 Wh L−1), also exceeding PBAs[19-21] and phosphovanadates[35-37] (<130 Wh kg−1 except for 218 Wh kg−1 of LiV2(PO4)3[35]) and standing comparison with Zn3V2O7(OH)2·2H2O (≈160 Wh kg−1),[29] and Zn0.25V2O5·nH2O (≈200 Wh kg−1 or 450 Wh L−1).[10] Figure 2d–g depict long‐term cycling performance. The IOF is capable of achieving stable voltage plateaus, high capacity retention of 83%, and an ultrahigh average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.996% over 100 cycles at 200 mA g−1. At a higher current density of 3 A g−1, the capacity retention and average CE reach as high as 75% and 100% over 3000 cycles (Figure 2f,g), respectively, which far exceed the vast majority of cathodes reported to date.[4-9] These exceptional performances verify the highly reversible Zn2+ intercalation chemistry of the IOF cathode.

The IOF also exhibits extremely high rate capability. The gravimetric discharge capacities reach 226, 223, 219, 210, 195, 181, 172, 167, 160, 152, and 135 mAh g−1 at current densities of 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 A g−1, respectively (Figure 3a). Such rate capability overwhelmingly outperforms PBAs, Mn‐based, and vanadium‐based compounds (Figure 3b) and enables ultrafast charging (71% state of charge in merely 1.9 min) and an ultrahigh power density of 7200 W kg−1, manifesting fast reaction kinetics of this Zn2+‐ion battery chemistry. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and rate‐scan CV analyses give a consistent Zn2+ diffusion coefficient (DZn‐ion) of 10−10 to 10−9 cm2 s−1 (Figure 3c, and Figure S7, Supporting Information), which is among the highest values of the currently available Zn2+ cathodes[10, 28, 29] and is even two to four orders of magnitude higher than Li+ diffusion coefficients within LiFePO4 and LiCoO2 (≈10−14–10−11 cm2 s−1).[38, 39] Rate‐scan CV also provides an understanding of the electrochemical kinetics based on Equation (1):[40]
𝑖 = 𝑎𝑣𝑏

where i is the peak current (A), a and b are adjustable parameters, and v refers to scan rate (V s−1). The b‐values corresponding to redox peaks A1, A2, and C1 are determined to be 0.832, 0.875, and 0.845, respectively (Figure 3d,e), indicating capacitance‐dominant kinetics for the IOF cathode chemistry.[40] The capacitive (k1) and diffusion contributions (k2) can be quantified according to Equations (2) and (3):[41]

It is deduced that the capacitive part accounts for 65.51% of the full capacity at a scan rate of 0.02 mV s−1, and increases to 86.61% at 0.15 mV s−1 (Figure S6, Supporting Information). This capacitance‐dominant behavior, together with the fast Zn2+ diffusion within the IOF, is directly responsible for the achieved ultrafast charging.

Dynamic simulations using a climbing image‐nudged elastic band (CI‐NEB) method are conducted to reveal the origin of the fast Zn2+ migration kinetics (Figure 3f–k, and Figure S8 and Table S2, Supporting Information). Figure 3f–j,k depict the Zn2+‐migration trajectories and corresponding energy profiles. Zn2+‐migration along a‐axis follows an approximate straight‐line pathway with an energy barrier of 0.79 eV, whereas a zigzag pathway and an energy barrier of 0.66 eV are revealed along b‐axis. It is therefore concluded that Zn2+ ions preferentially migrate through the lower‐barrier zigzag trajectory. This Zn2+‐diffusion barrier (0.66 eV) is substantially smaller than that of V2O5 (1.4 eV),[42] V2O5·1.75H2O (0.81 eV),[42] NaCa0.6V6O16 (1.08 eV),[26] NaCa0.6V6O16·3H2O (0.89 eV),[26] K2V8O21 (1.34 eV),[43] V6O13 (2.85 eV),[44] and V6O13·nH2O (0.87 eV),[44] and is even comparable to the Li+‐counterpart within LiFePO4 (0.55 eV),[45] illustrating ultrafast Zn2+‐migration kinetics within the IOF. We further unveil the impact of the lattice waters on Zn2+‐migration kinetics. Upon removal of the lattice waters, the crystal lattice shrinks by ≈31% in the b‐axis (Table S2, Supporting Information). Although the distances between neighboring Zn2+ are reduced, the diffusion barrier along the b‐axis increases to 0.81 eV (Figure 3g,i–k). While the spaces between Zn2+ barely change along a‐axis, the cross‐sectional contraction of hopping channels resulting from lattice water removal, however, attenuates the Zn2+‐migration dynamic and consequently leads to a significantly elevated diffusion barrier of 1.18 eV. Density of states (DOS) and charge density difference analysis provide further insights on the effects played by the lattice waters (Figure S9, Supporting Information). For the lattice‐water‐rich IOF structure, electron states from Zn overlap with O 2p states from water over a large energy landscape in the valence bands, indicating appreciable hybridization between Zn2+ and H2O (Figure S9a,b, Supporting Information). These observations coincide well with the charge density difference analysis which captures the occurrence of charge transfer from Zn2+ ion to the neighboring O anions of H2O (Figure S9d, Supporting Information). Such Zn2+–H2O interactions weaken the strong electrostatic interactions between Zn2+ and the host lattice and consequently facilitate fast Zn2+‐migration kinetics. These theoretical analyses are further verified by the control experiments where the dehydrated IOF exhibits deteriorated Zn2+ diffusion coefficients (derived from GITT analysis) and rate capability (Figure S10, Supporting Information). Besides, significant deterioration of long‐term cyclability is also observed with the dehydrated IOF, despite a higher capacity arising from the smaller molecular weight (Figure S10, Supporting Information). The combined theoretical and experimental analyses indisputably demonstrate the crucial “charge shield” role of the lattice waters in accelerating Zn2+ migration and enabling high structural and cycling durability of the IOF electrode.

To provide a mechanistic understanding of this new Zn2+‐intercalation chemistry, ex situ XRD and XPS are performed (Figure 4). Figure 4b depicts the crystal structural evolution of the IOF in response to (de)zincation. Upon initial discharge to 0.2 V, Bragg peaks (002), (110), (131), (220), and (114) gradually shift to lower 2θ angles by 0.06°, 0.08°, 0.05°, 0.06°, and 0.1°, respectively, which indicates a solid‐solution reaction mechanism and a negligible lattice volume expansion of 0.76% (Figure 4c). XPS analysis confirms the intercalation of 0.72 Zn2+ per formula unit (Figure 4d), in accordance with the achieved discharge capacity. The charge compensation is achieved via partial reduction of V5+ to V4+ and V3+, as evidenced by the appearance of characteristic XPS V4+‐2p bands (524.3 and 517.1 eV) and V3+‐2p bands (523.5 and 516.1 eV).[10, 31] Bader charge analysis further confirms the charge reduction of the V element upon Zn2+ intercalation (Figure S11, Supporting Information). Interestingly, the average Bader charges on oxygen change synchronously, indicating strong VO orbital hybridization. Upon reverse charge to 1.8 V, the abovementioned Bragg peaks shift back to their original positions (Figure 4b), and all the K+ and partial Zn2+ ions are extracted from the structure accompanying the oxidation of V3+ and V4+, yielding Zn0.55V2O4PO4·3.2H2O (Figure 4d,e). Note that the attempt of direct synthesis via both reflux and hydrothermal methods fails to obtain this electrochemically formed compound (Figure S12, Supporting Information), demonstrating the critical role of the in situ ion exchange. During the subsequent discharge, a significantly higher degree of Zn2+ intercalation (1.53 Zn2+ per formula unit) is observed with new XPS Zn‐2p bands emerging at 1046.6 and 1023.4 eV (labeled in red), and correspondingly, complete reduction of V5+ to both V4+ and V3+ occurs for charge compensation (Figure 4d,e, and Figure S11, Supporting Information). It is concluded that the removal of large‐ionic‐size K+ ions creates large interstitial vacancies accommodating Zn2+ and triggers the formation of Zn2.08V2O4PO4·3.2H2O. Besides, the distinct XPS Zn2+‐2p feature indicates the intercalated Zn2+ has weaker interactions with the host lattice than the original ones in Zn0.55V2O4PO4·3.2H2O, which favors fast Zn2+‐(de)intercalation and small lattice change.[10] While upon charge to 1.8 V, the IOF transforms back to Zn0.55V2O4PO4·3.2H2O, demonstrating the high reversibility of the Zn2+ intercalation chemistry (Figure 4d,e). Note that the substitute Zn2+ will not occupy the original positions of K+ ions due to the discrepancy of K+ and Zn2+ in ionic size and charge density and small local structural change occurs, which may be responsible for the additional weak diffraction peaks appearing at 19.5° and 35° (Figure 4b). Strikingly, despite (de)intercalation of a large amount of Zn2+, the IOF exhibits a negligible lattice volume change of <1% (Figure 4c). Such a quasi‐zero‐strain feature is directly responsible for the achieved high cycling durability.

To verify the application prospect, we estimate the cell‐level performance according to a prototype configuration where the active materials in cathode and anode account for 59 wt% to the total cell weight.[46] The cell‐level energy and power densities of the Zn‐IOF battery chemistry reach ≈90 Wh kg−1 and ≈3320 W kg−1, which far surpass the commercial Lead‐acid (30 Wh kg−1, 300 W kg−1),[47, 48] Ni‐Cd (40 Wh kg−1, 300 W kg−1),[47, 49] and Ni–MH batteries (55 Wh kg−1, 1200 W kg−1)[47, 48] (Figure 5a,b). The power density is even comparable to that of LIBs (3000 W kg−1 for graphite/LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (NMC) cells).[47] Considering the intrinsic safety from the aqueous nature, the heavy protection packaging required in LIBs could be eliminated or reduced, favoring an energy density close to and a power density well exceeding those of Li‐ion chemistry. Moreover, the ZIB chemistry provides improved cycle life and environmental friendliness, making it an excellent substitute or supplement to the existing battery systems. As a proof‐of‐concept, we fabricate prototype punch‐cell batteries and it is shown that two pouch cells in series are capable of lightening 118 light‐emitting diodes (LED) in parallel (Figure 5c,d). The pouch‐cell ZIB delivers electric energy of 6.5 mAh, ultrahigh energy retention of 98.5%, and average CE of ≈100% over 60 cycles at 100 mA g−1 (Figure 5e). At a higher current density of 500 mA g−1, the pouch cell provides electric energy of 4.3 mAh and the energy remains as high as 2.9 mAh after 600 cycles (Figure 5f). The achieved pouch‐cell performance further demonstrates the application feasibility of this new ZIB chemistry.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a reversible and ultrafast Zn2+ intercalation chemistry in a lattice‐water‐rich IOF crystal, which simultaneously mitigates two key issues facing ZIBs (cycling instability and sluggish kinetics). The quasi‐zero‐strain characteristic of the IOF ensures excellent cycling durability (3000 cycles) and average Coulombic efficiency of 100%. On the other hand, the abundant lattice waters as “charge shield” enable fast intrinsic solid‐state Zn2+‐migration kinetics, which, together with nanostructure effect, contribute to exceptionally fast chargeability and ultrahigh power densities. Combined with the scalable synthesis and low cost of the IOF as well as high cell‐level energy/power densities (90 Wh kg−1/3320 W kg−1), this new ZIB may emerge as a promising alternative to the existing battery systems for large‐scale energy storage. Moreover, lattice‐water‐rich IOF‐type materials could be extended to diverse aqueous batteries suffering from similar main issues (for instance, monovalent K+, divalent Mg2+/Ca2+, and trivalent Al3+ batteries), and inspire the future development of high‐performance batteries.
